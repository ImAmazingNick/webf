Not a dragon of fire, but a dragon of <em>cortisol</em> — the stress hormone that makes hearts race and palms sweat.</p>
<p>The kingdom’s solution had always been to keep the dragon sleeping. Never raise your voice. Never take risks. Never feel fear. But Mira noticed something: the kingdom was also never brave. Never creative. Never truly alive.</p>
<h2 id="the-journey">The Journey</h2>
<p>Mira descends into the dragon’s cave — not with a sword, but with curiosity. She learns that cortisol is not the enemy. It is the body’s alarm system, the engine of readiness, the chemical that turns a lazy afternoon into a moment of clarity.</p>
<p>The dragon tells her: <em>“I am not your enemy. I am your oldest friend. I kept your ancestors alive when tigers hunted them. I keep you sharp when the world demands it. The problem is not that I exist. The problem is that your kingdom forgot how to listen to me.”</em></p>
<h2 id="the-lesson">The Lesson</h2>
<p>Mira returns to the kingdom with a new understanding. Stress is not to be eliminated — it is to be befriended. The dragon becomes the kingdom’s advisor, teaching people when to activate and when to rest. The kingdom transforms from a place of false calm into a place of genuine resilience.</p>
