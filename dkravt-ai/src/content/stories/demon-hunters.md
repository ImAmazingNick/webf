In a world plagued by demons, three hunters set out to destroy them all. Each hunter is specialized: one fights fear demons, one fights anger demons, one fights sadness demons.

They are skilled. They are brave. They are effective. And yet, for every demon they slay, two more appear.

## The Twist

Deep in the Demon Wastes, they meet an old hermit who tells them the truth: the demons are not invaders. They are projections. Every suppressed fear, every swallowed anger, every unfelt sadness — each one materializes as a demon somewhere in the world.

The hunters are not solving the problem. They are perpetuating it. Every demon they "slay" is just pushed back underground, only to resurface stronger.

## The Resolution

The hunters must learn a new skill: not fighting, but feeling. They must sit with the fear, breathe through the anger, cry the tears. As they process their own emotions, the demons in the world begin to dissolve — not destroyed, but *integrated*.

*A story about shadow work, emotional intelligence, and the Jungian insight that what we resist, persists.*
