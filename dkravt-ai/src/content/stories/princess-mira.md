In a kingdom where everyone was always calm, Princess Mira discovered something terrifying: a dragon lived beneath the castle. Not a dragon of fire, but a dragon of *cortisol* — the stress hormone that makes hearts race and palms sweat.

The kingdom's solution had always been to keep the dragon sleeping. Never raise your voice. Never take risks. Never feel fear. But Mira noticed something: the kingdom was also never brave. Never creative. Never truly alive.

## The Journey

Mira descends into the dragon's cave — not with a sword, but with curiosity. She learns that cortisol is not the enemy. It is the body's alarm system, the engine of readiness, the chemical that turns a lazy afternoon into a moment of clarity.

The dragon tells her: *"I am not your enemy. I am your oldest friend. I kept your ancestors alive when tigers hunted them. I keep you sharp when the world demands it. The problem is not that I exist. The problem is that your kingdom forgot how to listen to me."*

## The Lesson

Mira returns to the kingdom with a new understanding. Stress is not to be eliminated — it is to be befriended. The dragon becomes the kingdom's advisor, teaching people when to activate and when to rest. The kingdom transforms from a place of false calm into a place of genuine resilience.

*A story for children about the neuroscience of stress, told through the language of fairy tales.*
