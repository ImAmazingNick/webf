In the Ural Mountains, where copper veins run through the rock like green blood, there lives a spirit. She appears as a beautiful woman in a dress of malachite, and she offers a bargain to every craftsman who enters her domain.

*"I will show you perfection,"* she says. *"I will show you what copper can become in the hands of a true master. But if you accept my gift, you will never be satisfied with anything less."*

## The Bargain

Stepan, a young stone-cutter, accepts. And the Mistress shows him wonders: copper that flows like water, malachite that holds the memory of every hand that touched it, crystal formations that encode mathematical truths no human has yet discovered.

Stepan becomes the greatest craftsman in the Urals. His work is breathtaking. But he can no longer enjoy a sunset, because it is not as perfect as the Mistress's underground gardens. He cannot love a human woman, because she is not as precise as a crystal lattice.

## The Price of Mastery

This is the ancient warning about mastery: it transforms not just your skill, but your perception. Once you have seen the best, everything else feels insufficient. The Mistress is not evil — she is honest. She shows the truth, and the truth is that perfection is a one-way door.

*Based on Pavel Bazhov's classic Ural tales, reimagined as a meditation on craft, obsession, and the cost of seeing too clearly.*
