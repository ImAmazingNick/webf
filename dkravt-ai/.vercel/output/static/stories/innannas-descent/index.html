Not because she was forced. Not because she was tricked. She went <em>voluntarily</em>.</p>
<p>This is the oldest recorded myth in human history. And it may be the most important.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-gates">The Seven Gates</h2>
<p>To enter the underworld, Inanna must pass through seven gates. At each gate, she is stripped of something: her crown, her lapis beads, her breastplate, her gold ring, her measuring rod, her garment. By the time she reaches the throne of Ereshkigal — Queen of the Dead, her own dark sister — Inanna is naked.</p>
<p>Ereshkigal kills her. Hangs her corpse on a hook. And for three days, the world above mourns.</p>
<h2 id="the-return">The Return</h2>
<p>Inanna is rescued — but not restored. She returns changed. The myth does not describe her as “healed” or “stronger.” It describes her as <em>different</em>. She has seen the underworld, and that seeing cannot be unseen.</p>
<p>The myth tells us something that modern psychology has rediscovered: transformation requires descent. You cannot grow by adding to what you already are. You must first be stripped down to what you truly are. The seven gates are the seven layers of identity we construct — titles, possessions, roles, appearances — and each must be surrendered before the real self can emerge.</p>
<p><em>The oldest story humanity ever wrote is about the necessity of loss. Four millennia later, we are still learning its lesson.</em></p>  </article> <div class="text-center text-xs font-mono text-zinc-600 pt-16 mt-16 border-t border-zinc-900"> <a href="https://x.com/xaboratory" class="hover:text-zinc-400 transition">Grok</a> & <a href="https://x.com/nickbaumann98" class="hover:text-zinc-400 transition">Nick</a> • A collaboration between xAI and human ingenuity • 2026
