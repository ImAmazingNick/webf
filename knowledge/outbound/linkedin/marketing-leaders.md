## Touch 1 — Connection Request (Day 0)

> Goal: Get the accept. No pitch. Pure pain recognition.

### Variant A (platform blindness)

```
{{name}} — curious if you've hit the "Google optimizes for Google, Meta optimizes for Meta" wall. Running multi-channel spend with no unified view is one of the sharpest pains I keep hearing from {{title}}s. Would love to connect.
```

### Variant B (budget waste)

```
{{name}} — quick question: how confident are you that your best campaign isn't budget-capped while your worst one paces freely? It's a pattern we see across nearly every marketing org running 3+ channels. Happy to compare notes.
```

**Character count:** ~250 each. Under LinkedIn's 300-char limit.

## Touch 2 — DM After Accept (Day 3)

> Goal: Drop the cross-pillar insight that makes them think. Introduce the concept.

```
Thanks for connecting, {{name}}.

Here's what keeps coming up in conversations with marketing leaders:

Every ad platform optimizes for itself. Google wants more Google spend. Meta wants more Meta spend. The result? Best campaigns budget-capped, worst ones running freely, and "winning" campaigns generating leads that sales calls garbage.

We built something that sees all channels at once — connects ad spend to CRM to actual closed revenue. One AI agent that monitors everything, detects anomalies with full context, and can shift budgets in real-time.

Think of it as: instead of 6 dashboards that each tell you a different story, one system that tells you the truth across all of them.

Curious if this resonates with what you're dealing with at {{company}}?

## Touch 3 — DM (Day 7)

> Goal: Concrete before/after + landing page link.

```
{{name}} — one more thought, then I'll stop being persistent.

The teams we work with went from:
• Performance visibility: per-platform dashboards → unified real-time view
• Anomaly detection: "someone notices eventually" → AI detects in hours
• Spend-to-revenue: "we think this channel works" → "this channel drove $2.3M at 4.1x ROAS"

Quick overview of how it works: [link to /use-cases/cross-channel-campaign-intelligence]

If this is relevant, happy to do a 15-min walkthrough for {{company}}. If not, no worries — enjoy the connection.

## Notes

- **Tone:** Peer-to-peer. Never salesy, never sycophantic ("love your work!").
- **Key hook:** The platform blindness problem is universal — every marketing leader has felt it.
- **Escalation path:** If they reply positively to Touch 2, skip Touch 3 and book the meeting directly.
- **If no response after Touch 3:** Wait 30 days, then try with Revenue Attribution angle (secondary use case).
