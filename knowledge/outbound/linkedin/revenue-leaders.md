## Touch 1 — Connection Request (Day 0)

### Variant A (blindsided by churn)

```
{{name}} — does this sound familiar? Post-churn analysis reveals the signals were there all along — in 5 different systems nobody connected. Curious if {{company}} has cracked real-time customer health scoring across all signals. Would love to connect.
```

### Variant B (scattered signals)

```
{{name}} — support tickets up, product usage down, NPS dropped, renewal in 60 days. Four tools, zero connection between them. Hearing this a lot from revenue leaders lately. Happy to compare notes.
```

## Touch 2 — DM After Accept (Day 3)

```
Thanks for connecting, {{name}}.

Here's the pattern we keep seeing:

Churn signals are scattered — product usage in one tool, support tickets in another, NPS in a third, billing in a fourth. By the time anyone connects the dots in a quarterly review, the customer has been shopping for months.

We built a system where one AI agent watches all of those signals continuously. It builds dynamic health scores based on what actually predicts churn in your business — not a generic formula. When risk spikes, it triggers specific retention actions that have worked for similar accounts.

One example: "ACME Corp — risk score 87%. DAU down 45%, 3 escalated tickets in 2 weeks, champion hasn't logged in for 22 days. Renewal in 60 days. Similar accounts churned 71% without intervention."

The agent doesn't just flag it — it recommends the exact intervention that saved similar accounts.

Curious if this is relevant to what you're seeing at {{company}}?

## Touch 3 — DM (Day 7)

```
{{name}} — last one from me.

Teams we work with went from:
• Signal detection: quarterly review → real-time, continuous
• Health scores: static spreadsheet formula → AI-dynamic, based on actual churn patterns
• Time to intervention: weeks → hours
• Retention actions: generic check-in → personalized, data-informed

Here's a quick overview: [link to /use-cases/churn-prevention]

A single enterprise churn = $200K–$2M lost ARR. If preventing even one matters at {{company}}, happy to show you how it works in 15 min. If not, genuinely enjoy the connection.

## Notes

- **Tone:** Empathetic, not fear-based. Revenue leaders know churn hurts — don't lecture them.
- **Key hook:** The "signals were there all along" pattern is universally felt after every churn post-mortem.
- **Escalation:** If positive reply to Touch 2, skip Touch 3 and book meeting.
- **If no response after Touch 3:** Wait 30 days, try Call Intelligence angle (secondary use case).
