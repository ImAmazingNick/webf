## Touch 1 — Connection Request (Day 0)

### Variant A (report trap)

```
{{name}} — you started an agency to do great marketing. How much of your team's week is spent pulling reports? Hearing from agency founders that Monday–Wednesday is reporting, not strategy. Curious if {{company}} has cracked this.
```

### Variant B (scaling pain)

```
{{name}} — quick question: does adding a new client at {{company}} still mean 5–15 new data sources, custom dashboards, and 2–6 weeks of onboarding? Every agency founder I talk to says scaling means hiring analysts, not serving more clients.
```

## Touch 2 — DM After Accept (Day 3)

```
Thanks for connecting, {{name}}.

Here's the pattern we see with agencies:

Every new client = 5–15 new data sources, custom dashboards, reporting templates, 2–6 weeks onboarding. Analysts spend Mon–Wed on reports. Strategy happens in the margins. And clients still notice campaign issues before you do.

The real pain: scaling means hiring analysts, not serving more clients. Margins shrink as you grow.

We built a system where one AI agent manages all clients simultaneously — 160+ data connections across 20 clients. It auto-generates branded PDFs, QBR decks with AI insights, and flags anomalies across every account before clients notice.

The shift: from 3–5 clients per analyst to 10–20+. New client onboarding goes from weeks to days. And you get something nobody else has — cross-client benchmarks. "Average CPL for B2B SaaS clients in your book: $87. This client is at $124."

Curious if this would change the math at {{company}}?

## Touch 3 — DM (Day 7)

```
{{name}} — one last note.

Agencies we work with went from:
• Client onboarding: 2–6 weeks → days
• Clients per analyst: 3–5 → 10–20+
• Reporting time: 30–50% of capacity → automated
• Issue detection: client notices first → AI alerts you first
• Scaling model: more clients = more headcount → more clients = higher margins

Quick overview: [link to /use-cases/agency-command-center]

If the math on scaling {{company}} doesn't work today, 15 min to show you what changes. If it already works — teach me your secrets.

## Notes

- **Tone:** Founder-to-founder. Agencies are entrepreneurial — respect the hustle.
- **Key hook:** "You started an agency to do great marketing, you spend half your time pulling reports." This lands every time.
- **Unique angle:** Cross-client benchmarks are a proprietary intelligence moat no competitor offers.
- **Escalation:** If positive reply to Touch 2, skip Touch 3 and book meeting.
