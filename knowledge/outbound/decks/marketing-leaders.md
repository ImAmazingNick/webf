## Slide 1 — The Problem

**Title:** Your ad platforms optimize for themselves. Not for your business.

**Bullets:**
- Google wants more Google spend. Meta wants more Meta spend.
- Best campaigns budget-capped, worst ones pacing freely
- "Winning" campaigns generate leads that sales calls garbage
- Agency vs. internal numbers never match

**Speaker notes:** This is the opening hook. Don't present it — ask "does this resonate?" and let them talk. Their response tells you which pain to lean into for the rest of the deck.

## Slide 2 — Why It Persists

**Title:** Every tool sees one thing. Nobody sees everything.

**Bullets:**
- Platform dashboards optimize for their own spend
- BI tools show whatever you manually feed them
- Reporting is weekly at best, stale by delivery
- No system connects ad spend → pipeline → closed revenue

**Speaker notes:** This is a structural problem, not a people problem. Acknowledge their team is good — the tools are the limitation. Source: `knowledge-graph.md` — "Every business tool today is brilliant in its silo and blind to everything else."

## Slide 3 — The Shift

**Title:** Connect → Learn → Analyze → Act

**Visual:** The 4-step sequence from knowledge-graph.md.

**Content:**
- **Connect:** 500+ pre-built connectors. Custom ones built by AI in minutes.
- **Learn:** Data flows into one knowledge graph. Agent maps relationships and builds business context.
- **Analyze:** Full context = cross-functional reasoning no single tool can do.
- **Act:** Pause campaigns, shift budgets, send reports, create tasks. Every action logged.

**Speaker notes:** This slide establishes that we're a platform, not just a tool. The foundation (connect + learn) is what makes the intelligence (analyze + act) possible. Source: `knowledge-graph.md` — the_principle section.

## Slide 4 — What Changes (Cross-Channel)

**Title:** One AI agent. All channels. Real-time.

**Bullets:**
- Monitors all platforms continuously against targets, budgets, benchmarks
- Alerts with full cross-channel context — not just the platform where the issue appeared
- Recommends (or executes) budget shifts based on actual revenue, not clicks

**Example alert (visual card):**
> "Meta Campaign X CPL up 47%. But SQL conversion 2x higher than benchmark. ROAS 3.2x. This is actually your best channel. Don't cut it."

**Speaker notes:** The example alert is the money slide. It shows the agent catching something a human would miss — and preventing a costly mistake. Walk through the logic slowly.

## Slide 5 — Before / After

**Title:** The transformation

| Dimension | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Visibility | Per-platform dashboards | Unified real-time view |
| Anomaly detection | Someone notices eventually | AI detects in hours |
| Budget reallocation | Quarterly meetings | Real-time, AI-driven |
| Reporting | 4–8 hrs/analyst/week | Automated |
| Spend-to-revenue | "We think this works" | "This drove $2.3M at 4.1x ROAS" |

**Speaker notes:** Let this table breathe. Ask which row matters most to them — it reveals their buying priority.

## Slide 6 — Revenue Attribution (The Bigger Picture)

**Title:** And that's just cross-channel. The same graph does full-funnel attribution.

**Bullets:**
- Connects first touch → every interaction → closed revenue
- Marketing sees CAC. Finance sees ROAS. Board sees marketing contribution to revenue.
- Same data, same graph, different views, zero arguments.
- Budget shifts based on actual revenue and projected LTV — not lead volume.

**Example:**
> "LinkedIn: high CPL, but leads convert to SQL at 2.4x average, close 18 days faster, 40% higher ACV. True ROAS: 6.2x."

**Speaker notes:** This is the expansion slide. Once they see cross-channel intelligence, attribution is the natural next question — "can you also show me which channels actually drive revenue?" Yes. Same graph. Source: `revenue-attribution.md`.

## Slide 7 — The Flywheel

**Title:** More data connected = smarter agent = better decisions = more trust

**Visual:** Flywheel diagram.

**Content:**
- Every new data source makes every existing insight smarter
- The knowledge graph compounds
- Cross-functional intelligence that would require a 20-person analytics org — delivered by one AI agent

**Speaker notes:** This is the moat slide. Competitors can build point solutions. Nobody else has the foundation (500+ connectors + knowledge graph + AI agent). The flywheel is why Improvado gets better the more you use it. Source: `knowledge-graph.md` — flywheel section.

---

## Slide 8 — CTA

**Title:** Every hour without the full picture, you're burning budget.

**CTA options:**
- "Book a demo — see your data in the knowledge graph"
- "15-minute walkthrough with your actual channels"

**Speaker notes:** Don't ask "any questions?" — ask "which problem should we solve first?" It moves the conversation from evaluation to action.

## Reusable Slides

Slides **2** (Why It Persists), **3** (The Shift), and **7** (The Flywheel) are identical across all cluster decks. Build once, reuse.
