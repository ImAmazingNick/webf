## Slide 1 — The Problem

**Title:** Your best customer is about to leave. Every signal is there. Nobody's connecting them.

**Bullets:**
- Support tickets up, product usage down, NPS dropped, renewal in 60 days
- These signals live in 4–5 different tools that don't communicate
- By the time anyone connects the dots (quarterly review), the customer has been shopping for months
- Post-mortem always reveals: "the signals were there all along"

**Speaker notes:** Open with "has this happened at {{company}}?" — every revenue leader has a churn story where the signals were obvious in hindsight. Let them tell it. Their story is your case study.

## Slide 2 — Why It Persists

**Title:** Every tool sees one thing. Nobody sees everything.

**Bullets:**
- CRM sees relationship history but not product usage
- Support tools see tickets but not revenue impact
- Product analytics sees usage but not billing or sentiment
- No system connects all signals with business context

**Speaker notes:** Same structural problem as the marketing deck — tools are siloed. A single enterprise churn = $200K–$2M lost ARR. Source: `knowledge-graph.md` core messaging.

## Slide 3 — The Shift

**Title:** Connect → Learn → Analyze → Act

**Visual:** The 4-step sequence from knowledge-graph.md.

**Content:**
- **Connect:** Product usage, support, billing, CRM, NPS, engagement — all in one graph.
- **Learn:** AI builds dynamic health scores based on what actually predicts churn in your business.
- **Analyze:** Full context = the agent sees patterns across all signals simultaneously.
- **Act:** Triggers retention actions — CSM tasks, champion outreach, exec sponsor calls, custom value reports.

**Speaker notes:** Emphasize "based on what actually predicts churn in your business." This isn't a generic health score formula — it's learned from their data. Source: `knowledge-graph.md` — the_principle section.

## Slide 4 — What Changes (Churn Prevention)

**Title:** From quarterly surprises to real-time protection.

**Bullets:**
- AI watches all churn signals continuously — not once a quarter
- Dynamic health scores learned from your actual churn patterns
- Every alert includes the full cross-functional picture
- Recommends specific interventions that saved similar accounts

**Example alert (visual card):**
> "ACME Corp — High churn risk (87%). DAU down 45%. 3 high-severity tickets in 2 weeks. Champion hasn't logged in for 22 days. Renewal: March 15. Similar accounts churned 71% without intervention. Recommended: exec sponsor call (saved 73% of similar accounts)."

**Speaker notes:** Walk through each signal in the alert. Point out: no single tool would catch this. It takes product data + support data + CRM data + historical patterns. That's the knowledge graph advantage.

## Slide 5 — Before / After

**Title:** The transformation

| Dimension | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Signal detection | Quarterly review | Real-time, continuous |
| Health scores | Static formula in a spreadsheet | AI-dynamic from actual churn patterns |
| Time to intervention | Weeks to months | Hours |
| Retention actions | Generic check-in | Personalized, based on what saved similar accounts |
| Post-churn analysis | "Signs were there" | Signs caught and acted on automatically |

**Speaker notes:** Ask which row matters most. If they say "time to intervention" — they have an active churn problem. If they say "health scores" — they have a measurement problem. Their answer shapes the demo.

## Slide 6 — Call Intelligence (The Bigger Picture)

**Title:** And the same graph hears every sales call too.

**Bullets:**
- 200 calls/week contain objections, competitor mentions, buying signals
- Today: <5% of recordings reviewed. Intelligence dies in recordings.
- The agent extracts from 100% of calls, connects to deal context, and acts immediately
- Objection patterns quantified: "Pricing objection in 38% of calls, up 12% MoM"

**Example:**
> "Competitor X mentioned in 34% of calls this week (up from 12%). Top accounts affected: ACME Corp ($420K opp), Globex ($280K opp). Common context: pricing comparison on enterprise tier."

**Speaker notes:** This is the expansion slide. Churn prevention protects existing revenue. Call intelligence helps close new revenue. Same knowledge graph, same AI agent. If they sell to enterprise with long cycles, this will resonate hard. Source: `call-intelligence.md`.

## Slide 7 — The Flywheel

**Title:** More data connected = smarter agent = better decisions = more trust

**Visual:** Flywheel diagram.

**Content:**
- Every new data source makes every existing insight smarter
- The knowledge graph compounds
- Cross-functional intelligence that would require a 20-person analytics org — delivered by one AI agent

**Speaker notes:** Source: `knowledge-graph.md` — flywheel section. The moat is the foundation. Nobody else has 500+ connectors + knowledge graph + AI agent.

## Slide 8 — CTA

**Title:** The signals are there. The question is whether you see them in time.

**CTA options:**
- "Book a demo — see your customer health in the knowledge graph"
- "15-minute walkthrough with your actual data"

**Speaker notes:** Close with urgency but not fear. Ask "how many accounts are up for renewal in the next 90 days?" It makes the problem concrete and immediate.

## Reusable Slides

Slides **2** (Why It Persists), **3** (The Shift), and **7** (The Flywheel) share core structure with the Marketing Leaders deck. Customize examples but keep the framework.
