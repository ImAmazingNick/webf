## Cumulative Sprint Summary

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Prospects researched | 20 | 40 | 65 | 90 | 115 | 145 | 175 |

## The Math

**Conservative assumptions:**
- 140 cold emails at 5% reply rate = 7 replies
- 105 LinkedIn touches at 12% reply rate = ~13 replies
- 20–30 signal-triggered messages at 10% reply rate = 2–3 replies
- Content-driven inbound inquiries = 1–3
- **Total conversations: 23–26**
- Meeting book rate from conversations: 25%
- **Expected meetings: 6–7, range 5–10**

**Why signal-triggered outreach punches above its weight:**
When someone just left a 2-star review of Looker, or just posted a job for their 3rd data analyst, or just got hired as the new CMO — your message lands differently. The pain is fresh. The timing is perfect. Reply rates are 2–3x cold. Even 20 signal-triggered messages can yield as many meetings as 100 cold emails.

## What Happens After Week 1

Based on Sprint Report results:

**If 5+ meetings booked:** The motion works. Week 2 priorities:
1. Maintain volume on Clusters 1+2
2. Add Cluster 3 (Data/Ops Leaders)
3. Consider setting up Instantly for email scale (move from Gmail manual to sequencer)
4. Build the self-assessment tool (Webflow) as an alternative CTA

**If 2–4 meetings booked:** Close but needs tuning. Week 2 priorities:
1. A/B test new subject lines and angles
2. Double down on signal-triggered outreach (higher conversion)
3. Increase LinkedIn volume (if accept rates are good)
4. Stay on Clusters 1+2 until proven

**If 0–1 meetings booked:** Diagnose the funnel:
1. Are emails being delivered? Check spam/bounce rates.
2. Are emails being opened? Subject line problem.
3. Are they opening but not replying? Message-market fit problem.
4. Are they replying but not booking? CTA or landing page problem.
5. Fix the weakest link before increasing volume.
