## Tweet 1 (Hook)

```
Your ad platforms are lying to you.

Not maliciously. Structurally.

Here's what I mean: 🧵
```

## Tweet 2

```
Google Ads tells you a campaign has a 4.1x ROAS.

Meta tells you a different campaign has a 3.8x ROAS.

LinkedIn tells you another has a 2.1x ROAS.

Add them up and you've "generated" 3x more revenue than your company actually earned.

Every platform takes credit for the same conversions.
```

## Tweet 3

```
But it gets worse.

Your best Google campaign is budget-capped.
Your worst LinkedIn campaign is pacing freely.

No platform is going to tell you to move money to a competitor's platform.

They optimize for their spend. Not yours.
```

## Tweet 4

```
Here's a real scenario:

A marketing team saw Meta CPL spike 47%. Dashboard says cut it.

But when you connect the ad data to CRM to closed revenue:

- Those leads converted to SQL at 2x the average
- They closed 18 days faster
- ACV was 40% higher
- True ROAS: 6.2x — the best in the portfolio

Without the full picture, they would have cut their best channel.
```

## Tweet 5

```
The fix isn't a better dashboard.

Dashboards show you what you feed them. They don't connect the dots.

The fix is connecting every platform to every downstream system:

Ad spend → website → CRM → pipeline → closed revenue

One view. Real-time. With actual business outcomes.
```

## Tweet 6

```
When you do this, the questions change:

Before: "What's our CPL?"
After: "Which channel drives the highest revenue per dollar when you factor in sales conversion, deal velocity, and customer quality?"

That's a different question. And it gets a different answer.
```

## Tweet 7 (CTA)

```
We built a system that does exactly this.

One AI agent that sees all channels, connects spend to revenue, and tells you where your money actually works.

If you're running multi-channel spend and making decisions on platform-reported ROAS — you might be cutting your best channels.
