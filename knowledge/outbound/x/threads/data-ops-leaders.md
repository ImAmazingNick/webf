## Tweet 1 (Hook)

```
Your data is worse than you think.

Not because your team is bad. Because nobody's actually watching.

Here are 5 ways bad data silently corrupts decisions: 🧵
```

## Tweet 2

```
1. The silent connector failure.

A Google Ads connector fails Tuesday at 3am. Nobody notices until the following Monday.

The weekly report shows a "30% performance drop." CMO cuts budget.

It wasn't a performance drop. It was a data gap. Budget cut based on a ghost.
```

```
2. The metric definition drift.

Meta quietly changes how they define "conversions." Your dashboard still shows the same column name.

Your team thinks performance improved 20%. Actually the denominator changed.

Nobody catches it for weeks.
```

## Tweet 4

```
3. The naming convention entropy.

Q1: campaigns follow {brand}_{channel}_{audience}_{date}.
Q3: half the team uses variations. Taxonomy is broken.

Your "top performing audience segment" report is aggregating 3 different naming conventions into one bucket.

The insight is wrong. The decision is wrong.
```

## Tweet 5

```
4. The reconciliation gap.

Salesforce says $2.1M closed-won. Stripe says $1.8M collected. Finance says $1.95M recognized.

Three systems. Three numbers. Nobody investigates the gap until board prep.

The answer: 2 duplicate records, 1 timezone mismatch, 1 currency conversion error.
```

## Tweet 6

```
5. The "real change vs data issue" confusion.

CPMs spike 45%. Is it a market shift or a tracking error?

Spend drops 100% at 3am. Is it a paused campaign or a broken connector?

Without a system that knows what "normal" looks like for every source, every anomaly triggers the same response: panic.
```

## Tweet 7

```
The fix isn't more dashboards. Dashboards display whatever you feed them.

The fix is continuous monitoring of every pipeline, every connector, every metric definition — with AI that learns what "normal" looks like and distinguishes real business changes from data issues.

"Google Ads spend dropped 100% at 3:47 AM — connector failure. Auto-reconnecting."

vs.

"Meta CPM increased 45% — real market movement. No data issue."
```

## Tweet 8 (CTA)

```
We built an AI agent that does this across every data source in your stack.

24/7 monitoring. Auto-reconnection. Naming enforcement. Metric definition tracking. Real-time data quality scores.

## Notes
- **Best time to post:** Wednesday, 9–10am ET
- **Data people love specifics** — the numbered format with concrete scenarios works well.
- **Engagement:** Ask "What's the worst data quality incident that caused a wrong decision at your company?" Data people have war stories too.
