## Tweet 1 (Hook)

The agency business model is broken.

More clients = more analysts = lower margins.

You started an agency to do great marketing. You spend half your time pulling reports.

Here's how the math breaks: 🧵
```

## Tweet 2

```
New client signs. Exciting.

Then reality:
- 5–15 new data sources to connect
- Custom dashboards to build
- Reporting templates to create
- 2–6 weeks before they're fully onboarded

Your team that was supposed to do strategy is doing setup.
```

## Tweet 3

```
Monday–Wednesday: pulling data, building reports, formatting slides.

Thursday–Friday: the actual strategy work.

But even Thursday gets eaten by: "Can you re-pull this with last week included?" and "The Meta numbers don't match what the client sees."

Sound familiar?
```

## Tweet 4

```
The worst part: clients still notice issues before you do.

Their Google Ads CTR drops 34% overnight. You find out when they email you, not when it happens.

That's the fastest way to lose trust. And in the agency business, trust = retention = revenue.
```

## Tweet 5

```
Here's the math that kills you:

At 3–5 clients per analyst, hiring is your growth bottleneck.

10 new clients = 2–3 new analysts.
20 new clients = 5–6 new analysts.

Revenue scales linearly. Costs scale linearly.

Margins don't improve. They compress. Especially when client complexity increases.
```

## Tweet 6

```
The escape:

1. Centralize all client data (160+ connections across 20 clients, managed by AI)
2. Automate reporting (branded PDFs, QBR decks, performance summaries — scheduled per client)
3. Proactive monitoring (AI detects anomalies across ALL clients, alerts account managers before clients notice)

Result: 10–20+ clients per analyst. Onboarding in days, not weeks.
```

## Tweet 7

```
But the real unlock most agencies miss:

Cross-client benchmarks.

"Average CPL for B2B SaaS clients in your book: $87. This client is at $124 — 43% above your portfolio average."

"Meta CPMs up 18% across all clients this week — platform trend, not account issue."

That intelligence is your moat. No single-client tool can build it.
```

## Tweet 8 (CTA)

```
We built this for agencies.

One AI agent managing all clients simultaneously. Automated reporting. Proactive monitoring. Cross-client intelligence.

More clients = higher margins (not more headcount).

If the agency math doesn't work today, there's a different way to run the model → [link in bio]

## Notes
- **Best time to post:** Tuesday, 9–10am ET
- **Agency founders are very active on X.** This is potentially the highest-engagement thread of the four.
- **Engagement:** Ask "What % of your team's week goes to reporting vs. strategy?" Agency founders will quote-tweet this with their own pain.
- **Quote RT strategy:** When agency founders complain about scaling or reporting, quote them with a relevant insight from this thread (without pitching).
