## Tweet 1 (Hook)

```
A $2M enterprise account churned last quarter.

The post-mortem revealed every signal was there.

In 5 different systems.

That nobody connected.

Here's exactly what happened: 🧵
```

## Tweet 2

```
Signal 1: Product usage dropped 45% over 8 weeks.
→ Sat in Amplitude. Nobody in CS saw it.

Signal 2: 3 high-severity support tickets in 2 weeks.
→ Sat in Zendesk. Account manager didn't know.

Signal 3: NPS score dropped from 9 to 4.
→ Sat in Delighted. Reviewed quarterly.
```

## Tweet 3

```
Signal 4: Their internal champion left the company.
→ LinkedIn showed it. CRM still had their name as primary contact.

Signal 5: Renewal was in 60 days.
→ Sat in Salesforce. CSM was focused on other accounts.

Each system saw its piece. No system saw the picture.
```

## Tweet 4

```
Here's what makes it painful:

If someone had connected these 5 signals 6 weeks earlier, the intervention was obvious:

- Exec sponsor call (saves 73% of similar accounts)
- Custom "value delivered" report
- Product roadmap preview addressing their tickets
- New champion identification

The playbook existed. The detection didn't.
```

## Tweet 5

```
This isn't an edge case. It's the default.

Every CS team I talk to says the same thing:

"We do churn post-mortems. The signals were always there. We just couldn't see them in time."

The problem isn't the people. It's the architecture.

Product usage in one tool. Support in another. Billing in a third. NPS in a fourth. CRM in a fifth.
```

## Tweet 6

```
The fix: one system that watches all signals continuously.

Not quarterly. Not when someone remembers to check. Continuously.

Dynamic health scores based on what actually predicts churn in YOUR business — not a generic formula.

And when risk spikes, automatic triggers: CSM task, champion outreach, exec escalation.
```

## Tweet 7 (CTA)

```
We built this.

One AI agent that monitors product usage + support + billing + NPS + CRM + engagement — and acts when the pattern matches churn.

A single enterprise save pays for itself 10x.

- **Best time to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 9–10am ET
- **The story format is key** — revenue leaders share war stories. This thread is a war story with a structural lesson.
- **Engagement bait:** Ask "What's the most expensive churn you caught too late?" in a reply to your own thread. Revenue leaders love sharing these.
