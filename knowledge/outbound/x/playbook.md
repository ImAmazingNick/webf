# X (Twitter) Playbook — Improvado Agent

> **Goal:** Build founder/product presence. Create the "I've seen this before" effect for 1:1 outbound. Drive landing page traffic.
> **Accounts:** Founder account (personal) + Company account. Founder account does the heavy lifting.
> **Tone:** Sharp, opinionated, specific. No corporate voice. Write like a founder who's solved a hard problem and wants to share what they learned.

---

## Strategy

X works in layers:

1. **Threads** — Deep-dive content per ICP cluster. The main content engine.
2. **Bangers** — Standalone tweets. Sharp observations. Build the follow.
3. **Replies** — Engage in conversations where your ICP hangs out. Build relationships.
4. **Retweet + commentary** — Amplify relevant voices with your take.

**The ratio:** 3 bangers : 1 thread : 5 replies per week.

## Bangers (Standalone Tweets)

> One sharp observation per tweet. These build the following. No links, no CTAs.

### Template Bank

**Category: Platform Blindness**

```
Google optimizes for Google. Meta optimizes for Meta. Nobody optimizes your total budget.

That's not a tool problem. That's an architecture problem.
```

```
Your ad platforms are competing for your budget. Not collaborating on your outcomes.

The tool that sees all channels wins. The tool that sees one channel lies.
```

```
"Our CPL went up 47%"

What your dashboard shows.

"CPL went up 47% but those leads convert 2x better, close 18 days faster, and have 40% higher ACV. True ROAS: 6.2x"

What happens when you connect ad data to pipeline to revenue.
```

**Category: Data Quality**

```
A connector failed last Tuesday. Nobody noticed for 5 days. The CMO cut budget based on a ghost.

This happens at companies that think they have good data.
```

```
The most expensive data quality issue isn't the one you catch.

It's the one nobody catches for 3 weeks while the leadership team makes decisions on it.
```

**Category: Churn**

```
Every churn post-mortem ends the same way:

"The signals were there."

In 5 different systems.

That nobody connected.
```

```
Support tickets up. Product usage down. NPS dropped. Renewal in 60 days.

Four tools. Four teams. Zero connection.

$500K ARR walks out the door.
```

**Category: AI Agents**

```
Hot take: AI agents without business context are just fancy autocomplete.

Claude Code works because it sees the entire codebase. Not because it's smarter.

Same principle applies to business. Context > capability.
```

```
Everyone's building AI agents.

Almost nobody is building the context layer that makes them useful.

The knowledge graph is the moat. The agent is the interface.
```

**Category: Agency**

```
You started an agency to do great marketing.

You spend half your time pulling reports.

The math is broken: more clients = more analysts = lower margins.

What if it was: more clients = higher margins?
```

## Reply Strategy

### Where to Engage

Search and monitor these topics daily:
- Marketing analytics, attribution, ROAS, CPL
- Data quality, data pipelines, ETL, broken dashboards
- Customer churn, retention, customer success
- AI agents in business, enterprise AI
- Agency operations, agency scaling, client reporting

### How to Reply

**Rule 1:** Add genuine value. Never pitch in a reply.

**Rule 2:** Share a specific insight or contrarian take. No "great point!" replies.

**Rule 3:** If someone describes a problem you solve, share the insight — not the product.

**Example replies:**

When someone complains about attribution:
```
The core issue: attribution tools only see part of the journey.

Last-click is a lie. First-touch is a different lie.

The only honest answer: connect every touchpoint to actual closed revenue and let the data show you which paths work.

We did this and found our "most expensive" channel was actually our highest ROAS — because we were measuring CPL, not revenue.
```

When someone asks about AI agents for business:
```
Biggest lesson building an AI agent for business ops:

The agent is 10% of the value.
The data foundation is 90%.

An agent that can reason but only sees your CRM is just a smarter Salesforce report. An agent that sees marketing + sales + support + finance + product simultaneously can do things no human team can do without 2 weeks of meetings.
```

When an agency founder vents about scaling:
```
Lived this. The formula is broken:

Client growth → Analyst hiring → Margin compression.

The fix we found: centralize all client data (160+ connections across 20 clients), automate reporting, and use AI to monitor everything. Went from 3-5 clients per analyst to 10-20+.

The real unlock: cross-client benchmarks nobody else has.
```

### Accounts to Engage With

Build a list of 50 accounts in each category:
- **CMOs / VPs Marketing** who tweet about campaigns, spend, analytics
- **Revenue leaders** who tweet about churn, pipeline, forecasting
- **Data leaders** who tweet about data quality, pipelines, infrastructure
- **Agency founders** who tweet about scaling, client management, margins
- **AI/tech founders** who tweet about agents, automation, business AI

Engage 5 accounts/day minimum. Genuine replies only.

## Rules

- **No corporate voice.** Write as a founder, not a brand.
- **No banned words:** revolutionary, game-changing, AI-powered, best-in-class
- **Never pitch in replies.** Share insight. If they ask "what do you use?" — then share.
- **Every thread must teach something.** If someone reads the thread and gets zero value without clicking a link, it's a bad thread.
- **Link in bio, not in tweets.** X suppresses tweets with external links. Put the landing page in bio. Reference it only in the last tweet of a thread.
- **Founder account first.** Company account retweets + adds context. People follow people, not logos.
