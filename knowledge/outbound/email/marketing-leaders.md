## Email 1 — Problem Diagnosis (Day 0)

> Goal: Recognition, not pitch. They should think "this person gets it."

### Subject Line A
```
the multi-channel budget problem at {{company}}
```

### Subject Line B
```
quick question about {{company}}'s cross-channel spend
```

### Body

```
{{name}},

Every marketing leader I talk to has the same problem:

Google optimizes for Google. Meta optimizes for Meta. Nobody optimizes your total budget across all channels — because no tool sees all of them at once.

The result:
- Best campaigns are budget-capped while worst ones pace freely
- "Winning" campaigns generate leads that sales calls garbage
- Agency reports don't match internal numbers
- Budget reallocation happens quarterly, not in real-time

Sound familiar?

I have a thought on how to fix this. Happy to share if useful.

Best,

## Email 2 — The Shift (Day 3)

> Goal: Introduce the concept + one concrete agent action. Reply to Email 1 thread.

### Subject Line
```
Re: the multi-channel budget problem at {{company}}
```

### Body

```
{{name}},

Quick follow-up — here's the core idea:

What if one system saw all your channels at once — ad platforms, CRM, and actual closed revenue — and could act on it?

Real example: "Meta Campaign X — CPL up 47%. But SQL conversion is 2x higher than benchmark and ROAS is 3.2x. This is actually your best channel. Don't cut it."

Without connecting ad data to pipeline to revenue, most teams would have cut that channel.

We built an AI agent that monitors all platforms continuously, detects anomalies with full cross-channel context, and recommends (or executes) budget shifts based on revenue — not clicks.

Worth 15 min to see if it's relevant for {{company}}?

## Email 3 — Before/After + CTA (Day 7)

> Goal: Concrete transformation. Clear CTA. Reply to same thread.

### Subject Line
```
Re: the multi-channel budget problem at {{company}}
```

### Body

```
{{name}},

Last note — here's what changes:

Before → After:
- Platform dashboards → unified real-time view across all channels
- "Someone notices eventually" → AI detects anomalies in hours
- "We think this channel works" → "This channel drove $2.3M at 4.1x ROAS"
- Quarterly budget meetings → real-time reallocation

15 min — I'll show you what {{company}}'s data would look like in one view. If it's not relevant, I'll tell you.
