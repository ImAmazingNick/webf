## Email 1 — Problem Diagnosis (Day 0)

### Subject Line A
```
churn signals at {{company}}
```

### Subject Line B
```
the post-mortem problem
```

### Body

```
{{name}},

Every churn post-mortem I've seen ends the same way:

"The signals were there. In 5 different systems. Nobody connected them."

Support tickets up. Product usage down. NPS dropped. Renewal in 60 days. These signals live in different tools — by the time anyone connects the dots in a quarterly review, the customer has been shopping for months.

A single enterprise churn = $200K–$2M lost ARR.

Sound familiar at {{company}}?

## Email 2 — The Shift (Day 3)

### Subject Line
```
Re: churn signals at {{company}}
```

### Body

```
{{name}},

Follow-up with the core idea:

What if one system watched all churn signals continuously — product usage, support tickets, NPS, billing, engagement — and triggered retention actions before it's too late?

Real example: "ACME Corp — risk score 87%. DAU down 45%. 3 escalated tickets in 2 weeks. Champion hasn't logged in for 22 days. Renewal: March 15. Similar accounts churned 71% without intervention."

The system doesn't just flag risk. It recommends the specific intervention that saved similar accounts — exec sponsor call, custom value report, roadmap preview — based on what actually worked.

Worth a 15-min look for {{company}}?

Last note — here's the shift:

Before → After:
- Signal detection: quarterly review → real-time, continuous
- Health scores: static spreadsheet → AI-dynamic from actual churn patterns
- Time to intervention: weeks → hours
- Retention actions: generic check-in → personalized, based on what saved similar accounts
