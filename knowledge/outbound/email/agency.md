## Email 1 — Problem Diagnosis (Day 0)

### Subject Line A
```
scaling {{company}} without scaling headcount
```

### Subject Line B
```
the agency reporting trap
```

### Body

```
{{name}},

Every agency founder I talk to has the same math problem:

New client = 5–15 new data sources, custom dashboards, reporting templates, 2–6 weeks onboarding. Analysts spend Monday through Wednesday on reports. Strategy happens in the margins.

And the worst part: clients notice campaign issues before you do.

Scaling means hiring analysts, not serving more clients. Margins shrink as you grow.

Is this the current reality at {{company}}?

## Email 2 — The Shift (Day 3)

### Subject Line

Re: scaling {{company}} without scaling headcount

### Body

{{name}},

Here's the idea:

What if one AI agent managed all your clients simultaneously — 160+ data connections, automated branded reports, and proactive anomaly detection across every account?

Real example: "Client: Bloom & Grow. Google Ads CTR dropped 34% overnight. Cause: competitor launched brand campaign. Recommend increasing brand bid 15%. Alert sent to account manager before client notices."

The shift: 3–5 clients per analyst → 10–20+. Client onboarding from weeks to days. And you get something nobody else has — cross-client benchmarks. "Average CPL for B2B SaaS in your book: $87. This client is at $124."

Worth 15 min to see if this changes the math at {{company}}?

Last note:

Before → After:
- Client onboarding: 2–6 weeks → days
- Clients per analyst: 3–5 → 10–20+
- Reporting: 30–50% of capacity → automated, branded PDFs
- Issue detection: client notices first → AI alerts you first
- Scaling: more clients = more headcount → more clients = higher margins
