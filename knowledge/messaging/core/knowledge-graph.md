## positioning

### one_liner

All your business data. One knowledge graph. One AI agent that thinks, alerts, and acts across all of it.

### elevator

Every business tool today is brilliant in its silo and blind to everything else. Improvado centralizes all business data — marketing, sales, support, product, finance, operations — into one knowledge graph. Then an AI agent operates across all of it. Full context. Deep reasoning. Real actions.

### analogy

Claude Code sees your entire codebase — that's what makes it a 10x engineer, not a fancy autocomplete. Improvado sees your entire business — that's what makes the AI agent a 10x operator, not another dashboard.

## the_principle

### sequence

```
CONNECT  →  LEARN  →  ANALYZE  →  ACT
```

### connect

The AI agent creates connections to relevant data sources — using 500+ pre-built connectors or building custom ones with AI in minutes.

### learn

Data flows into the business knowledge graph. The agent maps relationships, learns definitions, builds context, and populates the knowledge base with business-specific intelligence.

### analyze

With full context, the agent reasons across data — finding patterns, anomalies, and opportunities that no single-source tool can see.

### act

The agent takes actions — creating tasks, sending messages, updating platforms, generating reports, and triggering workflows across your stack.

### key_insight

Without the first two steps, the last two are impossible. This is why Improvado is a platform, not just an agent. The foundation is the moat.

## seven_pillars

**Sources:** Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, Pipedrive, Outreach, Gong, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, CPQ systems

**Captures:** Full pipeline (lead → MQL → SQL → opp → close). Deal velocity, win rates, loss reasons. Conversation intelligence. Territory performance. Forecast accuracy.

### support

**Sources:** Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, Gainsight, ChurnZero, NPS/CSAT tools

**Captures:** Ticket volume, resolution time, satisfaction scores. Issue trending. Health scores and churn signals. Feature request patterns. Support cost per customer.

### communications

**Sources:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, email metadata, calendar systems, meeting notes (Otter, Fireflies), internal wikis

**Captures:** Cross-team communication patterns. Decision trails. Meeting frequency. Knowledge sharing velocity. Bottleneck identification.

### product

**Sources:** Amplitude, Mixpanel, Pendo, Heap, PostHog, Jira, Linear, GitHub/GitLab, feature flag tools, A/B testing

**Captures:** Feature adoption, user journeys, drop-off points. Release impact. Bug-to-customer correlation. PLG signals. Engineering velocity.

### financial

**Sources:** QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Stripe, Chargebee, Recurly, ERP, expense management

**Captures:** Revenue by source/segment/product/geography. Unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback). Cash flow. Budget vs actual. Vendor ROI. Financial forecasting tied to ops data.

### operations_hr

**Sources:** BambooHR, Workday, Rippling, Google Workspace admin, procurement systems

**Captures:** Team structure, capacity. Hiring velocity, cost per hire. Employee engagement. Resource allocation vs outcomes. Compliance readiness.

## cross_pillar_connections

> What no single-purpose tool can do — the knowledge graph makes trivial.

| Connection | What It Reveals |
|---|---|
| Marketing spend → Sales pipeline → Revenue | True ROI by channel, not just leads |
| Product release → Support tickets → Churn | Real cost of shipping bugs |
| Campaign → Traffic → Sales calls → Deal velocity | Which campaigns accelerate the full funnel |
| Customer NPS → Product usage → Revenue retention | What drives loyalty and what kills it |
| Sales objections → Marketing messaging → Win rates | Whether your story matches your customer's reality |
| Finance budget → Campaign performance → Revenue forecast | Real-time financial planning tied to operations |
| Support themes → Product roadmap → Feature adoption | Whether you're building what customers need |

## three_levels

> What the AI agent does with full business context — from answers to autonomy.

### level_1_questions

**Cross-functional questions answered in seconds** (currently take weeks of meetings):

- "Which marketing channel has the highest ROI when you factor in support costs and churn rate — not just lead volume?"
- "We increased ad spend 40% last quarter. Did it actually accelerate pipeline, or just generate unqualified leads?"
- "Our NPS dropped 12 points in EMEA. Is that the product release, a support staffing gap, or a customer mix change?"
- "What's our true fully-loaded cost to acquire and retain a mid-market customer for 24 months?"
- "If we cut Brand spend by 30%, what happens to direct traffic, organic leads, and win rates over 6 months?"

### level_2_proactive

**The agent finds problems before you do.** Notices patterns, anomalies, and opportunities across the entire business:

- Monday 8am — CMO briefing: pipeline up, budget on track, one churn risk flagged
- Tuesday — CRO alert: 3 stalled deals match pricing objection pattern, recovery playbook attached
- Wednesday — VP Product alert: support spike from Tuesday's release, root cause identified, Jira ticket created
- Thursday — CEO weekly brief: revenue tracking +8% above forecast, one risk flagged with recommendation
- Friday — Finance notification: spend pacing analysis with reallocation recommendation and variance report

### level_3_actions

**The agent acts with approval** — pauses campaigns, shifts budgets, creates tasks, sends reports, updates records, drafts outreach, escalates issues, generates decks. Every action logged, auditable, governed.

## flywheel

```
More data sources connected
    → Richer knowledge graph
    → Smarter AI agent (more context = better reasoning)
    → More accurate insights and actions
    → More trust from teams → more data sources connected
    → [Flywheel accelerates]
```

Every new connection makes every existing insight smarter. The knowledge graph compounds. The AI agent's value compounds with it.

## day_in_the_life

### before

| Time | What Happens |
|---|---|
| 9am | Three people argue whether last month's campaign worked. Marketing says yes (leads). Sales says no (conversions). Finance can't tell. |
| 10am | VP Marketing requests cross-channel report. "We'll have it by Friday." It's Monday. |
| 11am | Product ships a feature. Nobody in marketing knows. |
| 2pm | CFO asks why spend is up 25%. CMO can't answer because the data is in three unreconciled platforms. |
| 4pm | Major customer files a bug ticket. Nobody connects it to 14 similar tickets. Account churns 3 months later. |
| EOD | Decisions on gut. Money wasted. Customer lost. Report still being built. |

### after

| Time | What Happens |
|---|---|
| 8am | AI agent sends CMO a Monday briefing: pipeline up, budget on track, one risk flagged. |
| 9am | The argument never happens. Full funnel visible: spend → leads → SQLs → pipeline → revenue. Real-time. |
| 10am | VP Marketing asks a question. Answer in 10 seconds with a chart. |
| 11am | Product ships. Agent notifies marketing, updates knowledge base, suggests new ad copy. |
| 2pm | CFO question pre-empted. Agent sent a spend variance note on Friday with full P&L impact. |
| 4pm | Bug ticket auto-matched to 14 others. Root cause identified. Jira ticket created. Affected accounts flagged for proactive outreach. |
| EOD | Every decision informed. Budget defended with data. Customer issue caught in hours. |

## messaging_derivatives

### homepage_hero

All your business data. One knowledge graph. One AI agent that thinks, alerts, and acts across all of it.

### homepage_sub

Every business tool is blind to everything outside it. Improvado connects all your data — marketing, sales, support, product, finance — into one knowledge graph. The AI agent reasons across all of it and takes action.

### pitch_deck

The more data you connect, the smarter the agent gets. That's the flywheel. And it only exists when you centralize everything — not just marketing.

### enterprise_sale

Other platforms give your teams isolated views. Improvado gives your AI agent the full picture — and the ability to act on it. Cross-functional intelligence that was previously impossible without a 20-person analytics org.

### conference_stage

Developers got Claude Code — an AI with full codebase context that writes, reasons, and ships. We asked: what if business teams had the same thing? Not for code — for decisions. Full business context. AI reasoning. Real actions. The knowledge graph is the codebase. The AI agent is the 10x operator.

### product_vision

We're not building a better BI tool. We're building the business knowledge graph — and the AI agent that operates on top of it. Every data source makes the entire system smarter. Every action is informed by every other data point in the graph.
