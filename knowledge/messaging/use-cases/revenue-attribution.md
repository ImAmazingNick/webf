# Marketing-to-Revenue Attribution (True ROI) — Messaging

> **Slug:** `revenue-attribution`
> **Page:** `/use-cases/revenue-attribution`
> **Target persona:** CMOs, CFOs, VP Demand Gen, Board Members
> **Core emotion:** Distrust — marketing and finance can never agree on the numbers

## hook

### headline

Marketing says it worked. Sales says leads were junk. **Finance can't prove anything.**

### subheadline

The gap between marketing metrics and business outcomes is where trust goes to die. Improvado connects the full journey — first touch to closed revenue — and gives every stakeholder one number they agree on.

## problem

### pain_bullets

- → Marketing reports leads and CPL. Sales reports pipeline and close rates. Finance reports revenue and ROI. These three views never reconcile.
- → CMO shows "42% pipeline increase." CFO shows "ROI declined 8%." Both correct. Both incomplete. Board loses confidence in both.
- → B2B sales cycles are 3–9 months. By the time a deal closes, the originating campaign is two quarters old. Nobody connects backward.
- → For agencies: proving spend-to-revenue is existential. Without it, you're a cost center.

### why_tools_fail

Last-click attribution is a lie. First-touch attribution is a different lie. BI tools require manual data stitching that's always stale. No existing tool connects every touchpoint to actual closed revenue with confidence intervals.

## foundation

### intro

True attribution requires connecting every stage of the customer journey. This is the most integration-heavy use case.

### source_groups

#### Top-of-Funnel — Where Awareness Starts

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Google Ads / Meta Ads / LinkedIn Ads / TikTok Ads | First-touch ad interactions, assisted conversions, view-through data |
| Programmatic (DV360, The Trade Desk) | Impression-level data, cross-device tracking |
| SEO tools (Semrush, Ahrefs) | Organic search touchpoints, content that drove initial visits |

#### Mid-Funnel — Where Engagement Deepens

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Google Analytics 4 / Adobe Analytics | Multi-session user journeys, event tracking, conversion paths |
| Marketing automation (Marketo, HubSpot, Pardot) | Email touches, content downloads, webinar attendance, lead scoring |
| Webinar platforms (Zoom, ON24) | Registration, attendance, engagement score |

#### Bottom-of-Funnel — Where Deals Happen

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Salesforce / HubSpot CRM | Opportunity creation, stage progression, close dates, deal values |
| Outreach / Salesloft | Sales touches, sequence engagement, meeting bookings |
| Gong / Chorus | Call interactions that progressed deals |

#### Revenue — The Truth

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Stripe / Chargebee / Recurly | Actual payment events, subscription start, revenue recognized |
| NetSuite / QuickBooks / Xero | Financial revenue data, billing reconciliation |

#### Customer Lifetime (for LTV-based attribution)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Product usage (Amplitude, Mixpanel) | Post-sale engagement, expansion signals |
| Billing (Stripe, Chargebee) | Expansion revenue, upsells, renewal events |

### knowledge_items

- **Touchpoint-to-revenue mapping:** The agent builds a complete graph of which touchpoints influenced which revenue — not based on a static model, but on what your actual data shows.
- **Journey archetypes:** The knowledge base learns common winning paths. "Enterprise deals that close typically include: LinkedIn ad → whitepaper → webinar → SDR call → demo → proposal. Average journey: 127 days."
- **Channel true value:** Not just last-click or first-touch. The agent learns which channels contribute at which stage, and what the incremental impact of each touchpoint actually is.
- **LTV-adjusted attribution:** Early-stage attribution is adjusted for customer quality — a channel that generates high-churn customers gets downgraded even if CPL looks good.
- **Confidence intervals:** The agent reports attribution with uncertainty ranges — "LinkedIn contributed $1.2M ± $180K (85% confidence)" — rather than false precision.

### setup_times

| Phase | Timeframe |
|---|---|
| Ad platforms + GA4 + CRM | Connected in days. Basic attribution in week 1. |
| Full-funnel data layer | 2–3 weeks for marketing automation + sales tools + revenue. |
| AI attribution model trained | Initial model in 2–3 weeks on historical data. Continuously refined. |

## solution

### intro

Unified attribution from AI — same data, same graph, different views, zero arguments.

### action_blocks

#### Gives every stakeholder their view

- Marketing sees: "LinkedIn Campaign X: 84 leads → 23 opps → $620K closed. CAC: $142."
- Finance sees: "Program spend: $340K. Revenue: $2.1M. ROAS: 6.2x."
- Board sees: "Marketing contribution to revenue: 47%. YoY efficiency: +22%."

#### Recommends budget shifts based on revenue

Not leads. Not clicks. Actual closed revenue and projected LTV.

> "Shifting $50K from Display (0.8x ROAS) to Content Syndication (4.1x ROAS) projects +$205K pipeline."

#### Alerts on under-investment

Detects when high-ROAS channels are budget-capped and recommends reallocation with projected revenue impact.

## before_after

| Dimension | Before | With Improvado |
|---|---|---|
| Attribution model | Last-click or "none" | AI-built multi-touch from actual revenue |
| Marketing-finance alignment | Quarterly arguments | One knowledge graph, same numbers |
| Time to revenue connection | Quarters of lag | Continuous, real-time |
| Budget optimization basis | Lead volume | Revenue attribution and projected LTV |

## knowledge_graph

### narrative

A marketing dashboard says LinkedIn has high CPL. The knowledge graph says LinkedIn has high CPL but those leads convert to SQL at 2.4x the average, close 18 days faster, and have 40% higher ACV. The true ROAS is 6.2x — the highest in your portfolio. Without connecting first-touch to closed revenue, you'd have cut the channel that drives your most valuable customers.
