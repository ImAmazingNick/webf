# Call Intelligence — Insight Extraction & Automated Actions — Messaging

## hook

### headline

Every sales call tells you what customers want. **That intelligence dies in a recording.**

### subheadline

Your reps make 200 calls a week. Each one contains objections, competitor mentions, and buying signals. Today, that data lives in recordings nobody watches. Improvado extracts it, connects it, and acts on it — automatically.

## problem

### pain_bullets

- → Reps hear the same pricing objection 30 times a month — but marketing doesn't know, so messaging never changes
- → A major account mentions a competitor on 4 consecutive calls — nobody connects the dots until the deal is lost
- → Feature requests surface daily in calls — they never reach product in a structured way
- → Post-call follow-up tasks get forgotten or delayed
- → Pipeline reviews are based on rep memory, not actual conversation data

### why_tools_fail

Call recording tools transcribe and tag — but don't connect call insights to marketing data, product usage, support tickets, or financial impact.

## foundation

### intro

The agent connects your call platforms to every system that gives those conversations business context.

### source_groups

#### Call & Conversation Intelligence (the raw signal)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Gong | Call transcripts, talk ratios, topics detected, competitor mentions, deal risk signals |
| Chorus (ZoomInfo) | Conversation analytics, key moments, coaching insights, deal intelligence |
| Fireflies.ai | Meeting transcripts, action items, topic detection across all meeting types |
| CallRail | Call tracking, source attribution, call recordings, keyword spotting |

#### CRM & Pipeline (the deal context)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Salesforce | Opportunities, stages, contacts, activities, deal history, forecasts |
| HubSpot CRM | Deals, contact timelines, lifecycle stages, task management |
| Outreach / Salesloft | Sequences, touchpoint data, rep activity, response rates |

#### Marketing (the upstream story)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Marketing automation (Marketo, HubSpot) | Lead source, campaign touchpoints, content engagement, lead scoring |
| Ad platforms (Google, Meta, LinkedIn) | Which campaign brought this prospect into the funnel |

#### Product & Support (the usage context)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Amplitude / Mixpanel / Pendo | Feature usage, adoption trends, activation status |
| Zendesk / Intercom | Open tickets, resolution times, satisfaction scores for the account |

### knowledge_items

- **Objection taxonomy:** The agent builds a structured map of every objection type, its frequency, which segments raise it, and which responses correlate with deal progression.
- **Competitor intelligence:** Every competitor mention is cataloged — what's being said, by which prospect types, and how it correlates with win/loss outcomes.
- **Feature demand signals:** Feature requests from calls are quantified and linked to account revenue potential — giving product teams a revenue-weighted roadmap.
- **Rep effectiveness patterns:** Which messaging approaches correlate with deal advancement? The knowledge base learns from thousands of calls what works.
- **Account narrative:** For each account, the agent builds a living story — every call, every objection, every promise, every sentiment shift — connected to pipeline stage and product usage.

### setup_times

| Phase | Timeframe |
|---|---|
| Call platforms connected | Minutes. Historical transcripts imported within hours. |
| CRM + marketing + product | Connected same day. |
| Knowledge base patterns | Objection and competitor maps emerge within first 2 weeks. |

## solution

### intro

Now that the agent has full call context connected to your entire business, here's what it does.

### action_blocks

#### Extracts across all calls

Objection patterns, competitor mentions, feature requests, buying signals, sentiment trends. Not one call at a time — all of them, continuously.

#### Connects to business context

Links call insights to deal stage, marketing source, product usage, and support history. A pricing objection from a $500K opportunity is very different from one on a $20K inbound lead.

#### Acts immediately

- Creates CRM follow-up tasks with specific next steps
- Alerts sales managers to emerging competitor threats
- Sends structured feedback to product teams weighted by revenue
- Updates marketing on objection trends that messaging should address
- Drafts and queues personalized follow-up emails

> "Competitor X mentioned in 34% of calls this week, up from 12%. Top accounts affected: ACME Corp ($420K opp), Globex ($280K opp). Common context: pricing comparison on enterprise tier."

## knowledge_graph

### narrative

A call tool tells you what was said. The knowledge graph tells you: this prospect mentioned competitor X. They came from a LinkedIn campaign targeting enterprise. Their support tickets increased 40% — they're shopping because their current vendor is failing. Similar accounts that switched converted 73% when offered expedited implementation. Recommend fast-tracking.
