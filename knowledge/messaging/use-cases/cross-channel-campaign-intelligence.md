# Cross-Channel Campaign Intelligence & Auto-Optimization — Messaging

## hook

### headline

Your ad platforms optimize for themselves. **Not for your business.**

### subheadline

Google wants more Google spend. Meta wants more Meta spend. Nobody optimizes your total budget across all channels — because no tool sees all of them at once. Until now.

## problem

### pain_bullets

- → A Meta campaign burned through $12K with CPL 3x your target — but nobody noticed because the Meta dashboard shows "impressions are up"
- → Your best Google campaign is budget-capped while your worst LinkedIn campaign paces freely — and no system connects them
- → Last month's "winning" campaign generated 400 leads that sales says were garbage — but marketing still counts it as a success
- → Your agency's report doesn't match your internal numbers — and the meeting is spent arguing instead of deciding

### why_tools_fail

Point solutions see one platform. BI tools see whatever you manually feed them. Nobody watches all channels with downstream sales and revenue context.

## foundation

### intro

Before the agent can optimize, it needs to see everything. Here's what it connects for this use case.

### source_groups

#### Advertising Platforms (the spend layer)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Google Ads | Campaigns, ad groups, keywords, spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, quality scores |
| Meta Ads | Campaigns, audiences, creatives, spend, reach, engagement, conversions by attribution window |
| TikTok Ads | Campaign performance, creative metrics, audience insights, spend |
| LinkedIn Ads | Sponsored content, InMail, lead gen forms, spend, engagement, demographic breakdowns |
| Programmatic (DV360, The Trade Desk) | Programmatic spend, impressions, viewability, brand safety, frequency |
| Amazon Ads | Sponsored products, brands, display — spend, ACOS, ROAS |

#### Website & Analytics (the behavior layer)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Google Analytics 4 | Sessions, user journeys, events, conversions, source/medium attribution |
| Adobe Analytics | Custom events, pathing, segment analysis, marketing channel data |

#### CRM & Sales (the outcome layer)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Salesforce | Leads, opportunities, pipeline stages, close dates, deal values, lead source |
| HubSpot CRM | Contact records, deals, lifecycle stages, marketing attribution |

#### Revenue (the truth layer)

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Stripe / Chargebee | Actual revenue, subscription data, payment events |
| NetSuite / QuickBooks | Recognized revenue, financial reconciliation |

### knowledge_items

- **Metric harmonization:** "Conversion" in Google means one thing, in Meta another. The agent maps them to your unified definition.
- **Campaign taxonomy:** It learns your naming conventions, maps campaign hierarchies, and flags inconsistencies.
- **Cross-platform entity resolution:** The agent understands that a lead who clicked a Google ad, visited your site, and became a Salesforce opportunity is one person — not three data points.
- **Benchmark baselines:** Historical performance becomes the baseline. The agent learns what "normal" looks like for each channel, campaign type, and audience segment.
- **Business rules:** Your target CPL, ROAS floors, budget caps, pacing rules — all encoded in the knowledge base and enforced continuously.

### setup_times

| Phase | Timeframe |
|---|---|
| Pre-built sources connected | Minutes. Data flowing within hours. |
| Custom sources via AI | Connectors ready in minutes. Validated same day. |
| Knowledge base populated | Core intelligence built within the first week. |

### custom_note

Need a source not listed? The AI agent builds custom connectors in minutes. Describe the platform, point to the API, and the agent creates the connection automatically.

## solution

### intro

Now that the agent sees everything and understands your business, here's what it does.

### action_blocks

#### Monitors continuously

Watches cross-channel performance against your targets, budgets, and benchmarks. Not once a week. Every hour.

#### Alerts with full context

Detects anomalies and explains them — with data from every connected source, not just the platform where the issue appeared.

> "Meta Campaign X CPL up 47% over 3 days. Lead quality also below average — 12% SQL conversion vs 28% benchmark. Recommend pausing and reallocating $8K to Google Campaign Y which has headroom and 3.2x ROAS."

#### Acts with your approval

- Pauses underperforming campaigns
- Adjusts budgets across platforms
- Sends updated reports to stakeholders
- Creates tasks for the media team to review creative
- Updates the CMO briefing for Monday

## before_after

| Dimension | Before | With Improvado |
|---|---|---|
| Performance visibility | Per-platform dashboards, manually reconciled | Unified real-time view, auto-harmonized |
| Anomaly detection | Someone notices eventually | AI detects in hours, alerts immediately |
| Budget reallocation | Quarterly planning meetings | Real-time, AI-recommended or auto-executed |
| Cross-channel reporting | 4–8 hours per analyst per week | Automated, scheduled, AI-generated |
| Spend-to-revenue connection | "We think this channel works" | "This channel drove $2.3M closed revenue at 4.1x ROAS" |

## knowledge_graph

### narrative

Single-platform dashboards tell you CPL went up. The knowledge graph tells you CPL went up, but SQL conversion from those leads is 2x higher, pipeline velocity is faster, and average deal size is 40% larger. Without connecting ad data to CRM to revenue, you'd have cut your best channel.
