## problem

### pain_bullets

- → Every new client = 5–15 new data sources, custom dashboards, reporting templates. 2–6 weeks onboarding.
- → Analysts spend Monday–Wednesday on reports. "Strategy" happens in the margins.
- → Clients often notice campaign issues before you do
- → Scaling means hiring analysts, not serving more clients. Margins shrink as you grow.

### why_tools_fail

BI tools require per-client setup. Reporting platforms don't cross-connect client data for benchmarks. No existing tool manages 160+ connections across 20 clients while proactively monitoring all of them.

---

## foundation

### intro

The agency use case is unique — the agent connects the same source types, but multiplied across every client account.

### source_groups

#### Per Client — The Standard Stack

| Source | Per Client |
|---|---|
| Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads | Client's ad accounts with client-specific credentials |
| Google Analytics 4 | Client's GA4 properties |
| Shopify / WooCommerce (ecommerce clients) | Client's store data — orders, revenue, products |
| Salesforce / HubSpot (B2B clients) | Client's CRM pipeline data |
| Email platforms (Klaviyo, Mailchimp) | Client's email campaign performance |
| Call tracking (CallRail) | Client's call attribution data |

#### Agency-Level — Cross-Client Intelligence

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Project management (Asana, Monday, Teamwork) | Task management, team utilization, client deliverables |
| Time tracking (Harvest, Toggl) | Billable hours, client profitability analysis |
| Finance (QuickBooks, Xero) | Client revenue, margins, billing status |

### knowledge_items

- **Client-specific context:** KPI targets, reporting preferences, brand voice for reports, key stakeholders, and escalation paths — per client.
- **Agency-wide benchmarks:** Cross-client performance data creates proprietary benchmarks. "Average CPL for B2B SaaS clients in your portfolio: $87. This client is at $124 — 43% above your book average."
- **Vertical patterns:** The agent learns industry-specific norms from your collective client data — what works in ecommerce vs B2B vs healthcare.
- **Seasonality and trend maps:** Cross-client data reveals platform-wide trends early. "Meta CPMs are up 18% across all clients this week — this is a platform trend, not an account issue."
- **Reporting templates and preferences:** Each client's preferred format, metrics, delivery schedule, and recipient list — all stored and applied automatically.

### setup_times

| Phase | Timeframe |
|---|---|
| New client onboarding | Days (down from 2–6 weeks). |
| AI-built custom connectors | Minutes for non-standard sources. |
| Cross-client intelligence | Emerging from week 1, deepening over time. |

### custom_note

20 clients averaging 8 platforms each = 160+ data connections. The AI agent manages all of them — connecting, monitoring, and auto-reconnecting if any break.

## solution

### intro

Instant client onboarding. Automated branded reports. Cross-client intelligence.

### action_blocks

#### Monitors all client accounts simultaneously

Detects anomalies and opportunities across every client. Sends alerts to account managers before clients notice issues.

> "Client: Bloom & Grow. Google Ads CTR dropped 34% overnight. Cause: competitor launched brand campaign. Recommend increasing brand bid by 15% and alerting the client proactively."

#### Automates client reporting

Generates branded PDFs, QBR decks with AI insights, and performance summaries — on schedule, per client preferences. Clients can ask the agent questions about their own data directly.

#### Unlocks cross-client intelligence

Your collective data becomes a competitive advantage. Industry benchmarks, platform trend detection, and performance insights no single-client tool can provide.

| Issue detection | Client notices first | AI alerts you first |
| Scaling model | More clients = more headcount | More clients = higher margins |

## knowledge_graph

### narrative

A single-client dashboard shows that CPMs went up. The agency knowledge graph tells you CPMs went up across all 20 clients — it's a platform-wide shift, not a client-specific problem. It also shows that your ecommerce clients are 23% more efficient than your B2B clients on Meta, that Client X is trending toward the bottom quartile of your book, and that onboarding Client Y's data sources will take 2 days based on your historical patterns. That's the difference between an agency and an intelligence operation.
