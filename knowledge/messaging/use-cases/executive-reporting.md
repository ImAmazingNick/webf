# Automated Executive Reporting & Stakeholder Briefings — Messaging

> **Slug:** `executive-reporting`
> **Page:** `/use-cases/executive-reporting`
> **Target persona:** CMOs, CFOs, Heads of Analytics, Agency Principals
> **Core emotion:** Exhausted — endless hours building reports that are stale on arrival

## hook

### headline

The report your CEO reads on Monday was **already wrong by Friday.**

### subheadline

Analysts spend days pulling data and building slides — only to present information that's already stale. Improvado generates stakeholder-ready briefings automatically, customized per recipient, on any schedule.

## problem

### pain_bullets

- → Weekly marketing report: 6–8 analyst hours. Data: 3–5 days old when read.
- → CMO, CFO, and CRO each get different views with different numbers. Meetings become arguments about data, not decisions.
- → CEO wants a one-pager. VP wants channel detail. Board wants quarterly trends. One report doesn't fit all — so the team builds five versions.
- → Ad-hoc requests derail the analytics team: "Can you pull…?" Each one: 30–60 minutes.

### why_tools_fail

BI dashboards require manual setup and maintenance. Spreadsheet reports are labor-intensive and stale. Neither personalizes output per stakeholder or answers follow-up questions.

## foundation

### intro

For an executive briefing to be truly cross-functional, the agent needs the full business picture.

### source_groups

#### Marketing Performance

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads | Spend, impressions, clicks, conversions across all paid channels |
| Google Analytics 4 / Adobe Analytics | Website traffic, conversion paths, engagement metrics |
| Email platforms (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, HubSpot) | Open rates, click rates, conversion, list health |
| SEO tools (Semrush, Ahrefs) | Organic rankings, traffic trends, keyword performance |

#### Sales & Pipeline

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Salesforce / HubSpot CRM | Pipeline value, stage progression, win rates, forecast accuracy |
| Outreach / Salesloft | Sales activity volume, sequence performance, response rates |

#### Financial

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| QuickBooks / Xero / NetSuite | Revenue, expenses, budget vs actual, cash flow |
| Stripe / Chargebee | Subscription revenue, churn, MRR/ARR, payment data |

#### Customer

| Source | What It Captures |
|---|---|
| Zendesk / Intercom | Ticket volume, satisfaction scores, resolution times |
| NPS/CSAT tools (Delighted, Qualtrics) | Customer sentiment trends |

### knowledge_items

- **Stakeholder preferences:** Who wants what, how often, in what format. The CEO wants a one-page summary. The VP wants channel-by-channel detail. The board wants quarterly trends. The agent remembers all of this.
- **KPI definitions and targets:** What "good" looks like for each metric, including how definitions differ between teams.
- **Historical context:** The agent knows Q1 is always slow, that Black Friday creates a seasonal spike, that last year's brand campaign had a 6-week lag effect on organic — so it contextualizes every number.
- **Anomaly baselines:** What constitutes a real change vs normal variance for each metric, so reports highlight what matters and ignore the noise.
- **Narrative patterns:** Over time, the agent learns how your organization tells its data story — the emphasis, the framing, the level of detail each audience expects.

### setup_times

| Phase | Timeframe |
|---|---|
| Core sources (marketing + CRM + finance) | Connected within days. |
| Full cross-functional view | 1–2 weeks for complete data layer. |
| First automated briefing | Generated within the first week. |

## solution

### intro

Configure once, in plain language. The agent handles everything else.

### action_blocks

#### Generates from the knowledge graph

Cross-functional, real-time, governed. Writes summaries, generates charts, formats per audience — all from one source of truth.

> "Every Monday at 8am, send the CMO a one-page summary: top-line revenue, spend, ROAS by channel, pipeline health, and anomalies."

#### Delivers via any channel

Email, Slack, Teams, or shared drives. Branded PDFs for clients. Scheduled or on-demand.

> "Every Friday, send each client a branded PDF with campaign performance and AI recommendations."

#### Responds to follow-ups

When the CEO replies "what drove the pipeline spike?" the agent answers in seconds with a follow-up chart, in the thread. No analyst needed.

## knowledge_graph

### narrative

A dashboard shows metrics. The knowledge graph tells the story behind them. It knows that pipeline spiked because the webinar series launched, that the spike correlates with a 23% increase in demo requests from enterprise accounts, and that similar patterns last year converted at 34% — so the forecast should be adjusted upward. Every briefing includes context no static report can provide.
