## Visual Philosophy: Fracture Point

The moment of comparison — DIY chaos on one side, unified AI intelligence on
the other. Every frame is a visual argument: fragmented tools and manual work
versus one seamless agent. The left/old/DIY side is dim, cluttered, slightly
warm-tinted to feel dated. The right/new/AI side is clean, unified, cool-toned
with mint and violet accents — the future. The contrast is dramatic and immediate.
The viewer should feel the relief of the right side before reading a word.

  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says DIY Reporting vs. AI Agent
  prominently across the top. Below, a dramatic split composition divided by
  a thin bright mint green vertical line in the center. Left side labeled DIY
  in small dim text, showing a cluttered messy desk scene with multiple laptop
  screens showing different disconnected tools — spreadsheets, manual reports,
  scattered browser tabs, dim warm-tinted lighting, chaotic overlapping windows.
  Right side labeled AI Agent in small bright text, showing a single sleek dark
  premium terminal interface with a unified clean dashboard, everything organized,
  cool violet and mint green data visualizations, crisp and calm. The contrast
  is dramatic — left is dim and cluttered, right is clean and luminous. Small
  bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button
  at the bottom center. Deep dark purple background on the right side. Premium
  enterprise B2B tech advertising style like Snowflake campaigns.

  downward-trending cost curve rendered as a luminous violet line on a dark
  grid, the line dramatically descending from left to right, with a bright
  mint green glow at the lowest point on the right marking the savings
  achieved. Small floating labels along the curve showing cost categories
  dissolving — manual labor, custom connectors, maintenance, debugging.
  The descending line creates a dramatic visual sweep. Deep dark purple
  void background with subtle gridlines. Small bold white text that says
  See How It Works in a rounded bright mint green button at the bottom.

  and falling apart in dim violet tones representing DIY complexity. On the
  right, the same pieces magnetically assembling into one sleek unified dark
  dashboard interface that glows with bright mint green data highlights,
  representing the AI agent bringing everything together. A bright beam of
  mint green light at the transformation point where fragments become whole.
  Motion blur on the assembling pieces suggesting dynamic energy. Deep dark
