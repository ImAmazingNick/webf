## Visual Philosophy: Weight vs. Weightless

The physical burden of DIY vs. the effortless levitation of the AI agent.
Left side has gravity, mass, clutter — things piling up, weighing down. Right
side is floating, clean, luminous — weightless intelligence. The contrast is
felt physically, not just visually.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: DIY Reporting *vs. Improvado*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Split-screen cinematic advertisement with a dramatic vertical divide.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says DIY Reporting vs. Improvado
  across the top of the image, centered. Below the headline, both halves have
  clean dark empty space before the visual content starts. The left half shows
  a dark room with a massive tower of stacked physical monitors, servers, and
  hard drives piled precariously on top of each other like a Jenga tower, cables
  tangling everywhere, warm amber warning lights blinking, everything about to
  topple over — overwhelming and unstable. The right half shows a single thin
  floating holographic screen hovering in clean dark space, displaying a
  beautiful unified dashboard with violet and mint green metrics, no cables,
  no clutter, just pure light and information — weightless and serene. A thin
  bright mint green vertical line separates the two halves. Small bold white
  text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom
  center. Deep dark purple background. Premium enterprise B2B tech advertising.
  Ultra-detailed commercial photography quality, razor-sharp at 8K.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: 500+ Sources. *One Agent.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement for enterprise AI platform. Very large bold
  clean white sans-serif text that says 500+ Sources. One Agent. prominently
  across the upper third. Below, a stunning visualization — hundreds of tiny
  floating platform logos and data source icons scattered across the frame
  from left to right — Google Ads, Meta, Salesforce, HubSpot, LinkedIn,
  Google Analytics, Shopify, Snowflake, TikTok, and many more — all rendered
  small and recognizable. All of them connected by thin luminous violet lines
  converging toward a single bright mint green hexagonal node at the center
  right of the image. The convergence point emits a soft volumetric glow.
  The icons on the far left are dim and scattered, becoming brighter and more
  organized as they approach the center. Small bold white text that says Book
  a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark
  purple void background with subtle grid depth. Premium data visualization
  advertising style like Snowflake or Fivetran campaigns. Meticulously
  crafted, master-level execution.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Stop Building. *Start Scaling.*
- cta: See How It Works
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Split-screen cinematic advertisement with a dramatic vertical divide.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says Stop Building. Start Scaling.
  across the top of the image, centered. Below the headline, both halves have
  clean dark space before the visual. The left half shows a person's desk from
  above, crowded with 47 open browser tabs visible on a laptop screen,
  spreadsheets printed on paper around it, a phone showing Slack notifications,
  sticky notes with formulas, an energy drink, dim warm tired lighting — the
  exhaustion of manual analytics work. The right half shows the same desk but
  completely clean — just one sleek laptop with a single dark terminal window
  open showing one clean AI agent interface with streaming results in violet
  and mint green, a plant, and a cup of tea — calm, cool blue-purple lighting,
  peaceful. A thin bright mint green vertical line separates. Small bold white
  text that says See How It Works in a rounded bright mint green button at
  bottom center. Premium enterprise B2B tech advertising. Professional
  advertising, impeccable composition, premium polish.
