## Visual Philosophy: Clean Break

The moment everything changes. Left is the old world — messy, manual, warm-toned,
exhausting. Right is the new world — unified, automated, cool-toned, calm. The
visual split is visceral and immediate. The viewer should FEEL the relief of the
right side before reading a single word. No subtlety — the contrast is the message.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: DIY Reporting *vs. AI Agent*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Split-screen cinematic advertisement with a dramatic vertical divide.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says DIY Reporting vs. Improvado
  across the top of the image, centered. Below the headline, both halves have
  clean dark empty space before the visual content starts. The left half shows
  a chaotic overhead view of a messy desk covered in sticky notes, printed
  spreadsheets, three open laptops showing different dashboards, coffee cups,
  tangled cables, crumpled papers — warm dim yellowish lighting, cluttered and
  stressful. The right half shows a pristine dark desk with a single sleek
  ultrawide monitor displaying one beautiful unified dark dashboard with clean
  metric cards glowing in violet and mint green — cool blue-purple lighting,
  minimal and calm. A thin bright mint green vertical line separates the two
  halves. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint
  green button at bottom center. The contrast between left chaos and right
  order is extreme and visceral. Premium enterprise B2B tech advertising style.
  Professional enterprise advertising, impeccable composition, premium polish.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: 40-65% *Lower TCO*
- cta: See How It Works
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement showing dramatic cost reduction for enterprise
  software. Very large bold clean white sans-serif text that says 40-65% Lower
  TCO prominently in the upper third, with the numbers 40-65% rendered extra
  large and impactful. Below, a stunning 3D visualization of a descending cost
  curve — a thick luminous line starting high on the left in violet, sweeping
  dramatically downward to the right where it ends at a bright glowing mint
  green point. The line passes through labeled floating waypoints as it descends:
  manual labor, custom connectors, maintenance staff, debugging hours — each
  label dissolving and fading as the line passes through. Below the curve, a
  subtle dark grid with depth perspective vanishing into the distance. Small
  bold white text that says See How It Works in a rounded bright mint green
  button at bottom center. Deep dark purple near-black background, cold color
  temperature, cinematic lighting. Premium data visualization style like
  Bloomberg financial charts. Museum-quality composition, the product of deep
  expertise.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Stop Building. *Start Scaling.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Dynamic cinematic advertisement with dramatic transformation visual.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says Stop Building. Start Scaling.
  across the upper third. Below, a powerful visual metaphor — on the left side,
  dark fragmented 3D puzzle pieces, broken gear icons, tangled wires, and
  scattered tool symbols tumbling apart in slow motion, lit in dim warm tones,
  representing DIY complexity. On the right side, the same fragments magnetically
  reassembling into one sleek unified dark dashboard interface with clean data
  visualizations glowing in violet and bright mint green, representing the AI
  agent bringing order from chaos. A bright beam of mint green light at the
  exact center where the transformation happens, fragments on the left dissolving
  into data streams that form the dashboard on the right. Motion blur on moving
  pieces suggesting energy. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a
  rounded bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark purple void
  background. Premium tech advertising style like Apple product launches.
  Ultra-detailed commercial quality, razor-sharp.
