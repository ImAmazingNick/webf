## Visual Philosophy: The Digital Graveyard

563,000 ads from 2014 sitting untouched in the account like tombstones.
96% have zero impressions — dead on arrival, never cleaned up. The
visual language is abandoned technology: dusty screens, powered-down
servers, ghostly translucent ads floating in darkness.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: 563K Ghost Ads. *Since 2014.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro

  across the upper third. Below, rows upon rows of small translucent
  ghostly ad thumbnails floating in dark space, stretching back into
  infinite depth perspective. Each ghost ad is faintly visible,
  semi-transparent, with a pale blue-white ethereal glow — dead but
  still present. The closest ads in the foreground are more visible,
  fading to near-invisible in the distance. One single ad card in the
  foreground glows bright mint green — the living signal among the
  ghosts. Atmospheric haze and dust particles in the air. Small bold
  white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button
  at bottom center. Deep dark purple void background. Cinematic ghost
  story aesthetic. Museum-quality composition.

  Very large bold clean white sans-serif text that says 96% Zero
  Impressions. prominently across the upper third, with 96% rendered
  extra large. Below, a dramatic dark field filled with hundreds of
  small dim circles arranged in a grid pattern. 96% of the circles
  are completely dark and hollow — dead, zero impressions. Only 4% of
  the circles glow faintly in mint green, clustered in one small
  corner. The vast sea of dead circles is overwhelming against the
  tiny cluster of living ones. Dramatic overhead lighting creating
  subtle shadows on each circle. Small bold white text that says Book
  a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep
  dark purple near-black background. Premium infographic advertising.
  Pristine execution.

  across the upper third. Below, a row of old computer monitors and
  screens from different eras arranged chronologically — a chunky 2014
  monitor on the far left, progressing through thinner models to a
  modern thin display on the far right. Every screen is dark and
  powered off except the rightmost modern one which shows a faint
  mint green pulse — the only surviving signal. Cobwebs between the
  older monitors. Dust particles floating in a shaft of dramatic
  side light. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded
  bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark purple
  background. Premium still life photography. Exhibition-grade.
