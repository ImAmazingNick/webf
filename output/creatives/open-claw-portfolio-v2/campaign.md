## Visual Philosophy: Orbital Command

One operator. Total visibility. The visual language borrows from orbital
surveillance and mission control — the feeling of seeing an entire world from
above, every data point visible simultaneously. Screens curve around the viewer
like a cockpit. Data doesn't flow — it orbits. The aesthetic is premium sci-fi
crossed with Bloomberg Terminal: dark, precise, information-dense but beautifully
composed. Deep purple-black void with dramatic volumetric lighting from screens
and holographic projections.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: One Agent. *Full Portfolio.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic wide-angle hero shot advertisement. Large bold clean white
  sans-serif text that says One Agent. Full Portfolio. across the upper third.
  Below, a breathtaking curved wall of floating holographic screens in a dark
  command center, seen from behind a single person standing at the console. Each
  screen displays a different client dashboard with colorful marketing charts
  and metrics glowing in violet, white, and mint. The screens wrap around the
  operator in a 180-degree arc like an IMAX theater. Dramatic volumetric god
  rays streaming down from above through atmospheric haze. The central screen
  is larger and brighter than the others, highlighted with a mint green glow
  showing unified portfolio analytics. Reflective dark floor catching screen
  light. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint
  green button at the bottom center. Deep dark purple near-black environment.
  Cinematic sci-fi film quality like Blade Runner 2049 or Minority Report.
  Meticulously crafted, master-level execution, painstaking attention to detail.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Your Entire Portfolio. *One Screen.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Extreme close-up photorealistic advertisement of a massive premium
  curved ultrawide monitor in a dark executive office. Large bold clean white
  sans-serif text that says Your Entire Portfolio. One Screen. across the upper
  third of the image. The monitor displays a stunning dark-mode dashboard with
  twelve client account tiles arranged in a 4x3 grid, each tile showing a
  different company name and key metrics — ROAS, revenue, spend — with tiny
  sparkline charts. One tile in the center glows bright mint green indicating
  an alert or insight. The monitor has ultra-thin bezels and a premium brushed
  metal stand. Soft violet ambient backlighting behind the monitor casting light
  on the dark wall. A single wireless mouse on the dark desk, nothing else.
  Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green
  button at bottom center. Deep dark purple room, minimal, premium. Apple
  product photography meets Bloomberg Terminal aesthetic. Ultra-detailed
  commercial photography quality, razor-sharp at 8K.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: See Every Client. *At Once.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Dramatic overhead bird's-eye view cinematic advertisement looking
  straight down at a futuristic circular holographic table projecting a
  three-dimensional city of data. Large bold clean white sans-serif text that
  says See Every Client. At Once. across the upper portion. The holographic
  projection rises from a sleek dark circular table surface, showing dozens
  of luminous vertical bars of different heights like a glowing miniature
  skyline — each bar represents a client account, some taller in violet,
  some shorter in white, one bar at the center glowing bright mint green
  and taller than all others. Thin luminous connection lines between the
  bars form a web of relationships. The hologram emits soft volumetric light
  upward into the dark room. The edges of the circular table are visible with
  subtle violet accent lighting. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo
  in a rounded bright mint green button below the hologram. Deep dark purple
  environment, cinematic overhead camera angle. Premium visual effects quality
  like a high-budget tech commercial. Pristine execution, exhibition-grade.
