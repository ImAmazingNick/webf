## Visual Philosophy: Convergence Nexus

The visual world is built around the moment of convergence — scattered business data
coalescing into a single luminous knowledge graph. Platform logos (Google Analytics,
Salesforce, HubSpot, Meta, Snowflake) float in deep purple void, each emitting faint
violet light. Luminous data streams flow from each logo toward a central nexus point
that glows bright mint green — the knowledge graph made visible.

The environment is vast, dark, and premium. Deep purple darkness extends in all
directions, punctuated only by the convergence architecture. Lighting is volumetric:
the central nexus casts outward illumination, while each platform logo carries its own
faint glow. The aesthetic is Bloomberg Terminal meets observatory control room —
precision instruments floating in infinite data space.

One constraint anchors every composition: the convergence point is the emotional center.
Everything flows toward it. The eye follows the data streams inward. The mint green
nexus is the only warm accent in a cold purple universe — the insight that connects
everything.

  point at center, each logo glowing faintly with its own brand colors against vast
  deep dark purple void, volumetric god rays emanating from the convergence point
  illuminating surrounding darkness, subtle hexagonal grid pattern fading into deep
  purple distance, shallow depth of field with logos slightly soft at edges and nexus
  razor-sharp, sense of massive scalability and infinite data space extending beyond
  frame. Premium enterprise B2B tech advertising style like Snowflake campaigns.
  Meticulously crafted, master-level execution, painstaking attention to every detail.

  showing the same data unified into one luminous knowledge graph visualization with
  glowing violet connection lines between nodes, one central node pulsing bright mint
  green, volumetric light spilling outward from the graph into deep purple void,
