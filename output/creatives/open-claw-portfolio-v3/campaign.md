## Visual Philosophy: Cockpit Supremacy

The operator's seat. The feeling of total command — hands on controls, every
metric visible, every client accounted for. The visual language borrows from
cockpits, luxury executive offices, and sci-fi bridge command. The key emotion:
calm authority. Not overwhelmed — in control. Deep purple-black environments
with violet instrument lighting and one mint-green focal point.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: One Agent. *Every Client.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic first-person POV advertisement from inside a futuristic
  spacecraft cockpit at night. Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says
  One Agent. Every Client. across the upper third. The cockpit view shows a
  wraparound instrument panel with dozens of small glowing screens and gauges,
  each displaying a different client dashboard with marketing metrics — ROAS,
  spend, conversions — in violet and white on dark panels. Through the cockpit
  windshield, a vast field of stars and a distant planet-like sphere made of
  luminous data nodes. The pilot's hands rest on glowing controls. One central
  HUD display directly ahead glows bright mint green showing unified portfolio
  stats. Dark cockpit interior lit only by instrument glow. Small bold white
  text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom.
  Deep dark purple environment, cinematic cockpit photography like Interstellar
  or The Martian. Meticulously crafted, master-level execution.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Your Portfolio. *One View.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement of a luxury corner executive office at night
  with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. Large bold clean white sans-serif text
  that says Your Portfolio. One View. across the upper third. The entire glass
  wall has become a massive transparent heads-up display showing client data —
  dashboard tiles, metric cards, trend charts — floating in front of a
  stunning nighttime city skyline with violet and white city lights far below.
  The data overlays are semi-transparent, showing the city through them. One
  metric tile glows bright mint green — the key portfolio insight. A single
  modern dark desk with one laptop sits in the foreground, minimal. The office
  is dark except for screen glow and city light. Small bold white text that
  says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom center.
  Deep dark purple tones, cold temperature, premium luxury tech aesthetic
  like a high-end real estate ad crossed with Bloomberg Terminal.
  Museum-quality composition, the product of deep expertise.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Total Client *Visibility.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Dramatic cinematic advertisement of a glowing translucent sphere
  floating in a dark room, containing a miniature universe of data inside it.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says Total Client Visibility.
  across the upper third. The sphere is about the size of a basketball,
  hovering above a sleek dark pedestal. Inside the sphere, tiny luminous data
  nodes connected by violet thread-like lines form a constellation pattern —
  each node is a client account. One node at the center of the sphere glows
  bright mint green, brighter than all others. The sphere emits soft volumetric
  light that illuminates the surrounding dark room. Subtle caustic light
  patterns on the pedestal surface from the sphere's glow. A person's hand
  reaching toward the sphere from the side, almost touching it. Small bold
  white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at
  bottom center. Deep dark purple room, dramatic single-subject composition.
  Premium sci-fi film prop photography. Pristine execution, exhibition-grade.
