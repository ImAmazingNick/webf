## Variant 1 — The Convergence
- layout: stat-hero
- model: fal:grok-imagine
- stat: $2.4M
- headline: saved when *silos* disappear
- cta: Book a demo
- body: One knowledge graph. Every source connected. Full context.
- text-effect: gradient
- badge: Trusted by 40+ enterprises
- prompt: Five distinct luminous data streams flowing from different angles
  of the frame, each a different shade within the violet spectrum — pale
  lavender, rich amethyst, deep electric violet #8068ff — all converging
  into a single brilliant radiant focal point that emanates clarity and
  warmth. The convergence point glows intensely with subtle mint #8affbc
  at its core, like the moment an answer crystallizes. Volumetric light
  rays emanate outward from the convergence through deep purple #20124d
  atmospheric void. Photorealistic cinematic lighting, shallow depth of
  field, the streams slightly blurred in motion while the focal point is
  razor sharp. Premium editorial quality. The feeling: five departments
  finally speaking one language. No text, no words, no letters, no logos.

## Variant 2 — The Command Center
- layout: product-frame
- model: fal:grok-imagine
- headline: One screen. *Full* business context.
- cta: See how it works
- body: The agent reasons across everything you connect.
- badge: SOC 2 Compliant
- prompt: A sleek ultrawide monitor on a clean dark matte desk in a
  minimalist executive office at dusk. The monitor displays an elegant
  dark-themed data interface with soft violet #8068ff chart accents and
  one small amber alert indicator being actively managed. Seven thin
  luminous data streams flow from the edges of the room toward the
  screen, each a slightly different hue of violet and blue — the
  feeling of all business intelligence converging into one surface.
  Soft ambient purple glow from the monitor illuminates the desk
  surface. Deep purple #20124d shadows. Shallow depth of field with
  the monitor razor sharp and the room softly blurred. Photorealistic
  editorial photography, cinematic studio lighting, quiet mastery.
  The feeling: a CMO's Monday morning briefing already waiting on
  screen. No text, no words, no letters, no logos, no readable screen
  content.

## Variant 3 — Before / After
- layout: split
- model: fal:flux-2-pro
- headline: Seven tools. One *blind* spot.
- cta: See how it works
- body: Every tool is brilliant in its silo. Blind to everything else.
- prompt: A visual transformation across the frame. On the left side,
  seven dim geometric fragments drift apart in deep dark purple #20124d
  void — disconnected, isolated, each fading at its edges, cold blue
  undertones, the feeling of data that cannot see itself. On the right
  side, those same seven fragments have been pulled together into one
  luminous interconnected structure — edges now touching, violet #8068ff
  light flowing between them, subtle mint #8affbc glow at the joints
  where connections form, warm edge lighting revealing the full shape.
  Strong directional light from the right illuminates the unified
  structure while the left remains in shadow. The contrast tells the
  story: fragmentation to clarity. Matte surfaces with precise edge
  lighting. Premium editorial quality. No text, no words, no letters,
  no logos.

## Variant 4 — The Agent Acts
- layout: bold-type
- headline: Dashboards *wait.* The agent *acts.*
- cta: Book a demo
- body: Insights arrive before you ask. Actions happen while you sleep.
- text-effect: outline
- rotate: true

## Variant 5 — The Flywheel
- layout: floating-element
- model: fal:nano-banana-pro
- headline: Every source makes every insight *sharper.*
- cta: Book a demo
- body: The knowledge graph compounds. So does the agent.
- text-effect: gradient
- prompt: An ascending double helix of interconnected luminous data nodes
  spiraling upward through the frame. Each node is a small precise
  geometric polyhedron glowing with violet #8068ff light, connected to
  its neighbors by thin luminous lines. The helix grows in both
  brightness and complexity as it ascends — lower nodes dimmer and
  simpler with 4-6 facets, upper nodes more intricate and radiant with
  12+ facets and mint #8affbc highlights at the apex. The lines between
  upper nodes glow brighter, denser, more active — representing
  compounding intelligence. Deep three-dimensional structure with a
  strong sense of upward growth frozen in motion. Sharp geometric detail
  throughout, shallow depth of field with the lower helix softly blurred.
  Premium editorial quality. No text, no words, no letters, no logos.
