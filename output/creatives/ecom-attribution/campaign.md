## Visual Philosophy: The Black Hole

Data goes in, nothing comes out. Amazon sits at the center of a
gravitational void that swallows attribution data from every other
platform. Meta drives the sale, Amazon takes the credit, and nobody
can prove otherwise. The visual language is cosmic: black holes,
event horizons, severed connections.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: 0% Cross-Channel *Attribution.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with cosmic void concept. Large bold
  clean white sans-serif text that says 0% Cross-Channel Attribution.
  across the upper third, with 0% rendered extra large and impactful.
  Below, a stunning black hole visualization — a dark sphere at the
  center with a bright accretion disk of violet and white light
  spiraling around it. Streams of luminous data particles flowing
  inward from the edges of the frame — representing Meta, Google,
  and other platform data — all being pulled inexorably toward the
  black hole and disappearing. The data streams glow in different
  colors as they approach but turn dark as they cross the event
  horizon. One thin stream escapes upward glowing bright mint green —
  the attributed path. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in
  a rounded bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark
  purple void background with subtle star field. Cinematic space
  photography. Meticulously crafted, master-level execution.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: The Attribution *Black Hole.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with dramatic data disappearance.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says The Attribution
  Black Hole. across the upper third. Below, three distinct glowing
  data streams approaching from the left side — one violet representing
  Meta, one blue representing Google, one amber representing Amazon.
  All three streams converge toward a massive dark void sphere in the
  center-right of the frame. The Meta and Google streams bend and
  distort as they approach the void, their data fragmenting and
  dissolving. The Amazon stream enters the void and nothing comes out.
  Around the void, a faint gravitational lensing effect distorts the
  background. A single bright mint green line emerges from the void
  on the right side — unified attribution escaping. Small bold white
  text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at
  bottom center. Deep dark purple space background. Premium VFX
  quality. Exhibition-grade.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Meta Drives Sales. *Amazon Takes Credit.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic split advertisement showing credit theft. Large bold
  clean white sans-serif text that says Meta Drives Sales. Amazon Takes
  Credit. across the upper third. Below, two sides separated by a thin
  vertical divide. The left side shows a bright glowing funnel or
  pathway representing a customer journey — a person seeing a Meta ad,
  being intrigued, moving toward purchase — rendered as a flowing
  luminous violet stream with energy. The right side shows the Amazon
  shopping cart icon receiving the purchase, glowing amber-gold, with
  a large 100% attribution label glowing next to it. Between the two
  sides, the connection is broken — a severed line, a gap, no data
  flowing between them. The left side gets 0% credit despite doing the
  work. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright
  mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark purple background.
  Premium advertising quality. Ultra-detailed.
