## Visual Philosophy: The Burn Rate

$2.4B in flames. Not a metaphor — campaigns that never convert running
indefinitely, 3-day-old data in a real-time world, 80% of accounts
impossible to analyze. The visual language is industrial: furnaces,
leaking pipes, frozen clocks.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: $2.4B Wasted. *Every Year.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with industrial scale waste concept.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says $2.4B Wasted. Every
  Year. across the upper third, with $2.4B rendered extra large and
  glowing slightly amber. Below, a massive dark industrial furnace or
  incinerator with its door open, casting intense red-amber firelight
  outward. Streams of digital data and small glowing ad thumbnails
  are being fed into the furnace from a conveyor-like stream, burning
  and dissolving into embers. The Amazon arrow logo faintly visible in
  the ember glow. One stream of data diverts to the side toward a
  clean mint green channel — the optimized path. Small bold white text
  that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom
  center. Deep dark purple near-black environment. Cinematic industrial
  photography. Museum-quality composition.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: 3-Day-Old Data. *Real-Time Rivals.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic split-screen advertisement showing speed disparity.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says 3-Day-Old Data.
  Real-Time Rivals. across the upper third. Below, a dramatic split
  with a thin mint green dividing line. The left half shows a frozen,
  cracked clock face stuck at 72 hours, encased in a block of ice,
  dim amber light behind it — stale, frozen, outdated. The right half
  shows a sleek modern digital display with live-updating numbers and
  metrics streaming in real-time, glowing bright violet and mint green,
  dynamic motion blur suggesting speed — competitors moving fast.
  The contrast between frozen and flowing is extreme. Small bold white
  text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at
  bottom center. Deep dark purple background. Premium tech advertising.
  Ultra-detailed, razor-sharp.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: 80% of Accounts. *Unanalyzable.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with chaos vs order concept. Large
  bold clean white sans-serif text that says 80% of Accounts.
  Unanalyzable. across the upper third, with 80% extra large. Below,
  a massive dark filing cabinet or server rack with dozens of drawers
  pulled open at random angles, papers and data sheets spilling out
  everywhere in chaotic disarray — campaign names with no conventions,
  random strings, duplicate labels. The whole structure is tilting
  and unstable. One drawer on the far right is neatly closed with a
  mint green label — organized, analyzable. Dramatic side lighting
  casting long shadows. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo
  in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark
  purple background. Premium photography. Pristine execution.
