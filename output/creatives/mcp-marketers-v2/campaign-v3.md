## Visual Philosophy: Marketers Empowered

Two angles of MCP in action: the human side (marketers connected to AI)
and the output side (autonomous task completion). The first visual draws
from the Claude Code hat aesthetic — three real marketers wearing signature
dark beanies, connected by luminous protocol lines to the Improvado
intelligence. The second is pure satisfaction: a giant terminal showing
marketing tasks checked off, the agent working autonomously.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: MCP for *Marketing Teams*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur, cartoon, illustration
- prompt: Cinematic studio portrait of three diverse marketing professionals
  standing side by side facing camera in a dark premium environment. Each
  person wears a stylish dark knit beanie hat in deep purple, reminiscent
  of a developer culture aesthetic. They are dressed in smart modern business
  attire — dark turtlenecks and blazers. Each person has a thin luminous
  bright violet glowing line extending upward from above their head,
  and all three lines converge together at a single point at the top
  center of the image forming a bright mint green glowing connection
  node where they meet. The three people are evenly spaced across the
  lower two-thirds of the frame, confident expressions, softly lit from
  the front. The luminous lines above them glow with energy as they
  travel upward and converge. Deep dark purple near-black background.
  Volumetric light from the glowing lines illuminates their faces subtly.
  Bold clean geometric Raleway-style sans-serif white text that says
  MCP for Marketing Teams across the upper area above the convergence
  point. A bright mint green rounded pill button with bold dark text
  that says Book a Demo at bottom center. Premium editorial portrait
  photography like Apple or Salesforce campaign imagery. Meticulously
  crafted, exhibition-grade execution.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Marketing on *Autopilot*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur
- prompt: Cinematic low-angle hero shot of a massive premium dark terminal
  window floating in deep purple void with slight 3D perspective tilt.
  The terminal has a sleek dark chrome frame with subtle violet edge
  lighting. On the screen, a clean dark interface showing three rows
  of completed marketing tasks, each row with a bright mint green
  checkmark on the left side followed by clean white monospace text.
  Row 1 checkmark then text that says Cross-channel report generated.
  Row 2 checkmark then text that says Google Ads budget rebalanced.
  Row 3 checkmark then text that says Q2 executive briefing sent.
  Each row has a subtle horizontal line separator. Below the three
  rows, a blinking cursor suggesting the agent is ready for the next
  task. The terminal screen emits soft volumetric light outward into
  the deep dark purple void. Subtle glass reflections on the terminal
  surface. Below the terminal, a faint reflection on a glossy dark
  floor. Bold clean geometric Raleway-style sans-serif white text
  that says Marketing on Autopilot in upper center above the terminal.
  A bright mint green rounded pill button with bold dark text that
  says Book a Demo at bottom center. Sense of calm authority and
  effortless automation. Premium tech advertising like Linear or
  Vercel campaigns. Ultra-detailed, pristine execution.
