## Visual Philosophy: Private Claw — Compelling & Lean

Five stunning compositions. Each one is a single powerful moment. The claw
is beautiful industrial design. Compositions are intentional — rule of
thirds, golden ratio, dramatic negative space. Think luxury tech ads meets
fine art photography. All text by Grok.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, noisy, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Stunning wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on deep dark
  purple background. Left third, clean typography: Open in white with thin
  red strikethrough, below Private in large bold mint green then Claw in
  white geometric sans-serif. Small gray text Your data. Your rules. Your
  agent. Right two thirds, a single magnificent robotic crab claw in
  three-quarter view, dark brushed purple metal with hairline violet circuit
  traces and bright mint green edge glow. The claw is open wide and between
  its tips it cradles a small perfect holographic cube of data — the cube
  rotates slightly showing tiny analytics charts on each face, glowing with
  soft multicolor light. The cube casts a gentle mint green light upward
  onto the inner claw surface. Vast dark empty space. Single dramatic key
  light from upper left creating beautiful shadows. Shallow depth of field
  with the cube tack sharp. At bottom right, small hot pink pill button
  Book a Demo. Hasselblad product photography quality, the data cube as
  precious object.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, noisy, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Elegant wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on deep dark
  purple background. Center top, Open in white with red strikethrough next
  to Private in mint green then Claw in white sans-serif. Small gray text
  Your data. Your rules. Your agent. Below center, two robotic crab claw
  tips meeting precisely in the exact center of the frame, touching tip to
  tip like Michelangelo Creation of Adam. Left claw tip dark purple metal
  with violet glow. Right claw tip identical. Where the tips almost touch,
  a tiny brilliant spark of mint green light. The spark is the only bright
  element. Both claws emerge from opposite edges of the frame. Vast dark
  negative space above and below the meeting point. Dramatic symmetrical
  composition. Soft violet ambient. At bottom center, small hot pink pill
  button Book a Demo. Creation of Adam reinterpreted, the spark of
  intelligence, symmetrical perfection.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, noisy, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Bold wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on deep dark
  purple background. Left side, Open in white with red strikethrough, below
  Private in large mint green then Claw in white. Small gray text Your data.
  Your rules. Your agent. Right side, extreme close-up macro shot of just
  the mint green glowing edge of a robotic crab claw, filling the right
  half of the frame with beautiful abstract detail. The edge glows bright
  mint green like a lightsaber blade, with tiny violet circuit traces
  visible in the metal surface at macro scale. The metal texture is
  gorgeous — brushed dark purple titanium with microscopic details. Shallow
  depth of field with only the nearest edge sharp, everything else soft
  bokeh in dark purple. The abstract beauty of the tool itself. At bottom
  right, small hot pink pill button Book a Demo. Macro abstract photography,
  the beauty of precision engineering, extreme detail.

## Variant 4
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, noisy, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Cinematic wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on deep dark
  purple background. Open in white with red strikethrough next to Private in
  mint green then Claw in white at top left. Small gray text Your data. Your
  rules. Your agent. The lower two thirds shows a robotic crab claw reaching
  from the bottom of frame upward at a dramatic diagonal angle, dark purple
  metal with mint green edges. Above the claw, floating in the upper portion
  of the frame, five small identical translucent cards are arranged in a
  perfect ascending staircase pattern going from lower left to upper right.
  Each card is minimal: just a small icon and a clean metric. The cards get
  progressively brighter from dim violet at bottom to bright mint green at
  top, suggesting growth and progress. The claw reaches toward the brightest
  top card. Clean geometric arrangement. Vast dark space. At bottom right,
  small hot pink pill button Book a Demo. Ascending staircase composition,
  progress visualization, geometric elegance.

## Variant 5
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, noisy, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Refined wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on deep dark
  purple background. Left third, Open in white with red strikethrough, below
  Private in large mint green then Claw in white. Small gray text Your data.
  Your rules. Your agent. Center right, a robotic crab claw in elegant
  profile, dark purple metal with mint green edge. The claw holds a single
  thin transparent screen showing a beautiful clean dashboard with one
  prominent upward trend line in mint green. From the screen, the trend line
  extends beyond the screen edge and continues as a glowing mint green light
  trail that arcs gracefully across the dark space toward the upper right
  corner, like the data is breaking free from the screen into the real
  world. The light trail leaves fading sparkle particles. The claw presents
  the data and the data takes flight. Vast dark space. Soft violet ambient.
  At bottom right, small hot pink pill button Book a Demo. Data liberation
  composition, the trend line escaping the screen, poetic motion.
