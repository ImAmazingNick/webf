## Visual Philosophy: Crab Swarm Convergence

One epic story: a swarm of mini robotic crabs each grabbing a different
platform, report, or dashboard and carrying them all toward a central
glowing unified hub. The visual metaphor: many agents grabbing scattered
data and bringing it to one place. All text by Grok.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Open Claw for Marketing
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading
- prompt: Epic dramatic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story
  format on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold
  clean white geometric sans-serif text that says Open Claw for Marketing.
  Below the headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular
  weight that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights.
  with periods not all capitals. The full vertical frame shows a spectacular
  scene of dozens of small robotic crabs swarming from every direction toward
  a glowing central hub in the middle of the frame. Each mini crab is a
  sleek dark purple metallic robot with glowing violet circuit veins and
  bright mint green claw tips. Every crab is carrying something different
  in its claws — one drags a glowing Google Ads dashboard, another grips a
  Meta campaign report, another carries a Salesforce CRM screen, one hauls
  a revenue attribution chart, another clutches a HubSpot pipeline view,
  one carries a Google Analytics traffic graph, another grabs a TikTok
  performance card, one holds a LinkedIn campaign panel. The crabs stream
  in from the top edges, sides, and bottom corners, all converging toward
  the center. At the center is a magnificent glowing hexagonal hub platform
  pulsing with bright mint green and violet energy, where several crabs have
  already arrived and are placing their dashboards into a single unified
  holographic master dashboard that floats above the hub showing combined
  metrics from all platforms in one beautiful visualization. Glowing data
  streams trail behind each crab as they move toward center. The scene looks
  like a coordinated swarm intelligence operation. Volumetric violet light
  radiates from the central hub. Tiny luminous data particles fill the air.
  At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold
  white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Swarm convergence
  composition, coordinated chaos meets unified intelligence, every crab
  uniquely detailed.
