## Visual Philosophy: Luminous Instruments

The AI agent as an active operator — not a passive dashboard, but a presence
that builds, creates, and acts across marketing platforms simultaneously.
The visual language shifts from "connection" to "creation and action." Think
war room meets artist studio: the agent as both strategist and craftsman,
manipulating marketing reality in real-time.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Analyze. Build. *Act.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur
- prompt: Cinematic overhead dramatic shot of a massive circular holographic
  command table in a dark futuristic war room, viewed from slightly above.
  On the table surface, multiple holographic marketing interfaces float as
  3D projections being actively manipulated — one section shows a beautiful
  BI dashboard being assembled piece by piece with charts and KPI cards
  materializing, another section shows a Google Ads campaign interface with
  glowing bid adjustment sliders being moved, a third section shows a
  polished executive report generating page by page. At the center of the
  table, a luminous bright mint green AI core pulses with energy, with thin
  violet light threads extending outward to each interface — the agent
  controlling everything simultaneously. The table surface is dark glass
  reflecting the holographic projections. Deep dark purple environment,
  volumetric light rising from the table surface illuminating the ceiling.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says Analyze. Build. Act.
  positioned in upper center of the image. Small bold white text that says
  Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green pill button at bottom center.
  Sense of commanding power and effortless multi-tasking. Premium sci-fi
  production design like Blade Runner 2049 meets Bloomberg Terminal.
  Meticulously crafted, master-level execution, painstaking detail.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Your Agent *Speaks Marketing.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur
- prompt: Extreme close-up cinematic shot of a sleek dark AI terminal screen
  angled in dramatic 3D perspective, floating in deep dark purple void. On
  the screen, a natural language chat interface shows a typed question about
  marketing performance. But the response is not just text — it is
  physically materializing OUT of the screen as real 3D holographic objects:
  a stunning BI dashboard with violet bar charts and a bright mint green
  trend line rising upward floats above the screen to the right, a polished
  campaign report with data tables assembles itself mid-air to the left,
  and small recognizable platform logos — Google Ads, Meta, Salesforce —
  orbit the materializing objects with tiny green checkmarks next to each
  indicating active connections. The screen emits warm volumetric light
  that illuminates the floating artifacts. Particles of data stream from
  the screen surface into the forming objects. Deep dark purple background
  with the screen and its projections as the sole light source. Large bold
  clean white sans-serif text that says Your Agent Speaks Marketing. in
  upper center. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded
  bright mint green pill button at bottom center. Sense of language
  becoming reality, words transforming into actionable artifacts.
  Premium product advertising like Apple keynote production quality.
  Ultra-detailed commercial photography, exhibition-grade.
