## Visual Philosophy: Claw Closeup Reach

Close-up shots of robotic crab claws reaching in from the edges of the
screen, each gripping a different platform logo or report. The viewer
feels surrounded by claws grabbing everything. Intimate, dramatic,
scroll-stopping. 2 platform logos + 3 reports. All text by Grok.

- prompt: Dramatic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story format
  on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold clean

  the headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight
  that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with
  periods not all capitals. The frame shows an extreme close-up of multiple
  robotic crab claws reaching into frame from every edge of the screen. From
  the upper left, a massive dark purple metallic claw with glowing violet
  circuit veins and bright mint green edges grips a glowing Google Ads logo
  and dashboard. From the upper right, another claw reaches in holding a
  Meta Ads logo with campaign metrics screen. From the middle left, a claw
  extends inward gripping a glowing revenue attribution report with colorful
  pie charts and dollar figures. From the middle right, a claw holds a
  campaign performance report showing bar graphs and CTR metrics. From the
  bottom center, a claw reaches upward carrying an executive summary report
  with clean KPI cards. All five claws converge toward the center of the
  frame where there is a bright glowing mint green focal point where the
  data merges into one unified stream. Each claw is hyper-detailed with
  visible armor plates, circuit vein textures, mechanical joints, and
  reflective metallic surfaces. Shallow depth of field with the nearest
  claws sharp and background slightly soft. Dramatic violet rim lighting
  on each claw edge. Floating data particles between the claws. At the
  very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white
  text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Immersive close-up composition,
  claws surrounding the viewer, cinematic macro detail.

  enormous robotic crab claws in the foreground as if they are your own
  hands. The left claw holds a glowing Google Ads dashboard screen tilted
  toward the viewer. The right claw holds a glowing Meta campaign screen.
  Between the two claws, floating in mid-air at different heights in the
  vertical frame, three holographic report screens hover: a revenue
  attribution report with funnel visualization at the top, a campaign
  performance report with line graphs in the middle, and a marketing ROI
  summary report with big numbers at the bottom. The claws are dark purple
  metallic with incredible close-up detail showing armor plates, glowing
  violet circuit veins, bright mint green razor edges, mechanical joint
  mechanisms. The holographic screens cast colorful light onto the claws.
  Dark atmospheric background with violet ambient light. Floating luminous
  data particles drift between the screens. At the very bottom center, a
  bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says Book a
  Demo with pink glow. First-person POV composition, you are the crab,

  periods not all capitals. The frame is filled with a tight close-up of
  two massive robotic crab claws crossed in an X shape in the center of the
  frame, creating a dramatic crossed-arms pose. Sandwiched between the
  crossed claws, five glowing holographic screens are stacked vertically
  like cards in a fan arrangement. The top screen shows a Google Ads
  dashboard with the logo visible. The second screen shows a Meta Ads
  campaign panel with the logo. The third screen is a revenue report with
  colorful charts and big revenue numbers. The fourth is a campaign
  performance report with conversion funnels. The fifth at bottom is a
  marketing analytics summary with trend lines. The two claws are dark
  purple metallic with extreme detail, glowing violet circuit veins
  pulsing, bright mint green edges blazing, mechanical joints visible. The
  screens glow and cast rainbow light reflections onto the metallic claw
  surfaces. The crossed claws create a protective cage around the data.
