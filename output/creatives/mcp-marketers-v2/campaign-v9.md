## Visual Philosophy: Claw Squadron

Three totally different crab personalities — a pirate captain, a hacker,
and a kaiju giant. Each is fun, bold, scroll-stopping, and tells the
Open Claw + MCP story from a different angle. All text rendered by Grok:
headline, subheading, pink button. Premium 3D quality but with humor and
character. ARRRR!

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Treasure *Your Data*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean
- prompt: Fun bold cinematic advertisement on deep dark purple background.
  At the top center, large bold clean white geometric sans-serif text that
  says Treasure Your Data. Below the headline, smaller subtle gray
  uppercase text that says OPEN CLAW · POWERED BY MCP. In the center, a
  single magnificent stylized robotic crab character standing triumphantly
  on top of a glowing treasure chest. The crab is a premium 3D rendered
  cyberpunk robot with dark purple metallic armor plating, glowing violet
  circuit trace lines across its shell, and bright mint green glowing
  claw tips. The crab wears a stylish dark pirate captain tricorn hat
  with a small glowing mint green skull and crossbones emblem on it. One
  eye is covered by a tiny dark eye patch while the other eye glows bright
  mint green menacingly. The treasure chest below is open and overflowing
  not with gold but with glowing holographic marketing dashboards, small
  floating platform logos like Google Ads and Meta and Salesforce spilling
  out, luminous data charts and golden KPI numbers cascading out. The crab
  has one claw raised triumphantly holding a small glowing data gem. Dramatic
  volumetric purple lighting from below. Glossy dark reflective floor.
  At the bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold
  white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Premium Pixar-quality
  3D character meets pirate movie poster aesthetic. Exhibition-grade fun.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Release *the Claw*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean
- prompt: Cool bold cinematic advertisement on deep dark purple background.
  At the top center, large bold clean white geometric sans-serif text that
  says Release the Claw. Below the headline, smaller subtle gray uppercase
  text that says MCP FOR MARKETING. In the center, a stylized robotic
  crab character sitting at an epic curved array of six holographic
  floating screens arranged in a semicircle around it like a gaming or
  hacker command station. The crab is a sleek dark purple metallic robot
  with glowing violet circuit lines and bright mint green glowing eyes
  wearing tiny headphones on its head. Its two claws are extended forward
  touching two of the holographic screens — the left claw manipulating a
  Google Ads dashboard, the right claw adjusting a Meta campaign panel.
  The other screens show Salesforce CRM, analytics charts, a live
  marketing report being generated, and a budget allocation interface.
  Each screen casts colorful light onto the crab. The crab looks focused
  and cool, leaning forward in an intense hacker pose. Neon violet and
  mint green ambient lighting. Small floating data particles around the
  screens. Dark glossy reflective surface below. At the bottom center, a
  bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says
  Book a Demo with pink glow. Premium cyberpunk gaming aesthetic meets
  enterprise tech. Meticulously crafted, every screen detail precise.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Deploy *the Claws*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean
- prompt: Epic dramatic cinematic advertisement on deep dark purple
  background. At the top center, large bold clean white geometric
  sans-serif text that says Deploy the Claws. Below the headline, smaller
  subtle gray uppercase text that says OPEN CLAW · MCP INSIDE. In the
  center, a dramatic low-angle hero shot looking upward at a massive
  giant robotic crab towering over a miniature glowing city of marketing
  tools below it. The giant crab is an imposing premium dark purple
  metallic kaiju-style robot with heavy armor plates, glowing violet
  circuit veins pulsing across its entire body, and enormous claws with
  bright mint green glowing edges raised dramatically against the sky.
  Its eyes glow intense bright mint green. Below the giant crab, a tiny
  miniature cityscape made of floating marketing platform buildings —
  small Google Ads tower, Meta headquarters, Salesforce building, HubSpot
  office — each building glowing with data. The crab is protectively
  standing over the city like a guardian. Dramatic upward volumetric
  light beams in violet from the city illuminating the crab from below.
  Atmospheric haze and tiny data particles in the air. Movie poster
  composition with the crab as the towering hero. At the bottom center,
  a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says
  Book a Demo with pink glow. Premium kaiju movie poster meets tech
  advertising. Ultra-detailed, cinematic grandeur, awe-inspiring scale.
