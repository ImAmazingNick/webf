## Visual Philosophy: Open Claw Quintet

Five dramatically different kaiju crab stories. Same "Open Claw for
Marketing" headline with space in Open Claw. Same mixed-case subheading.
Each variant pushes a totally unique composition and emotional angle.
All text rendered by Grok. Pink button. Let's make these the best five yet.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Open Claw for Marketing
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, duplicate logos,
  repeated icons, all caps subheading
- prompt: Epic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story format on
  deep dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold clean white
  geometric sans-serif text that says Open Claw for Marketing. Below the
  headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight that
  says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with periods
  not all capitals. In the center, a massive robotic kaiju crab emerging
  dramatically from a swirling vortex portal of glowing data. The portal is
  a huge spiral of violet and mint green energy filling the middle of the
  frame, made of swirling marketing metrics, numbers, chart fragments, and
  platform logos spinning in the vortex. The crab bursts forward out of the
  portal toward the viewer, its dark purple metallic armor gleaming, glowing
  violet circuit veins pulsing, bright mint green claw edges blazing, green
  eyes piercing through the energy storm. One claw reaches forward breaking
  through the portal plane. Behind the vortex, faint silhouettes of Google
  Ads, Meta, and Salesforce logos orbit in the swirl. Dramatic radial light
  burst from the portal center. Energy particles exploding outward. At the
  very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white
  text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Portal emergence composition,
  explosive energy, cinematic sci-fi grandeur.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Open Claw for Marketing

  white geometric sans-serif text that says Open Claw for Marketing. Below
  the headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight
  that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with
  periods not all capitals. In the center, a majestic robotic kaiju crab
  sitting on a massive throne made entirely of stacked glowing holographic
  marketing dashboards and data screens. The throne is tall and imposing,
  built from layered screens showing Google Analytics charts at the base,
  Meta Ads performance in the middle, Salesforce CRM pipelines forming the
  armrests, revenue attribution graphs as the backrest. The crab sits
  regally on the throne, dark purple metallic armor with glowing violet
  circuit veins, bright mint green glowing claws resting on the dashboard
  armrests, piercing mint green eyes looking directly at viewer with calm
  authority. A faint crown-like holographic glow above the crab head in
  violet. The throne room floor is glossy dark reflective surface with
  violet light reflections. Volumetric light beams from behind the throne.
  At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold
  white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Royal throne composition,
  commanding presence, data kingdom aesthetic.

  white geometric sans-serif text that says Open Claw for Marketing. Below
  the headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight
  that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with
  periods not all capitals. Extreme dramatic close-up portrait of a massive
  robotic kaiju crab face filling most of the vertical frame. The shot is
  tight on the crab head and upper body, showing incredible detail of the
  dark purple metallic armor plating, intricate glowing violet circuit veins
  like living circuitry across every surface, heavy layered shell plates
  with subtle battle damage and wear. Two enormous bright mint green glowing
  eyes stare directly at the viewer, intense and intelligent. The two claws
  frame either side of the face at the edges, their mint green edges
  glowing. Reflected in the glossy surface of the crab armor, tiny
  reflections of marketing dashboards and platform logos are visible like
  data stored inside the crab. Shallow depth of field with background
  blurred to dark purple bokeh. Dramatic rim lighting in violet along the
  edges of the shell. At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded
  pill button with bold white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow.
  Intimate portrait composition, hyper-detailed macro quality, commanding
  eye contact.

  says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with periods
  not all capitals. The frame shows a powerful robotic kaiju crab in an
  action pose, both massive claws smashing together in the center creating
  an explosive burst of glowing data. The collision point erupts with bright
  mint green and violet energy, marketing metrics scattering outward like
  sparks — small floating numbers showing ROAS 4.2x, CTR 3.8%, Revenue $2.1M,
  CPA $12 radiating from the impact. The crab is dark purple metallic with
  heavy armor, glowing violet circuit veins, mint green claw edges and eyes
  blazing with intensity. Below the crab, shattered fragments of old
  spreadsheets and manual reports crumble and fall downward, replaced by the
  clean glowing data above. A shockwave ring of violet energy expands from
  the claws. Dark atmospheric background with dramatic backlighting. At the
  very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white
  text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Action impact composition,
  explosive data transformation, blockbuster movie energy.

  data, silhouetted against a massive glowing moon behind it. The moon is
  huge and fills the upper background, glowing in violet and mint green hues.
  The crab stands triumphantly at the summit, dark purple metallic armor
  gleaming in moonlight, violet circuit veins glowing, both claws raised
  high in victory pose with bright mint green edges blazing against the moon
  backdrop. Below the mountain, a vast landscape of miniature glowing
  marketing platform cities stretches to the horizon — clusters of tiny
  buildings labeled Google Ads, Meta, Salesforce, HubSpot, each city
  connected by glowing data highways. The crab is the guardian overlooking
  its entire domain. Atmospheric mist and floating luminous particles. At
  the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold
  white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Summit victory
  composition, epic fantasy movie poster, vast scale and grandeur.
