## Visual Philosophy: Private Claw Analytics Takeover Round 2

Three more ~~Open~~ Private Claw creatives. Each one features a single
crab claw actively taking over analytics tasks — checking boxes, dragging
dashboards, organizing reports. Rebellious energy. All text by Grok.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Dramatic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story format
  on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, the word Open in
  white geometric sans-serif text with a bold red diagonal strikethrough line
  crossing it out, next to it Private in large bold bright mint green
  geometric sans-serif text then Claw in large bold white text. Below,
  smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text that says Your data. Your rules.
  Your agent. not all capitals. The main visual shows a giant robotic crab
  claw reaching from the left side of frame, dark purple metallic with
  glowing violet circuit veins and bright mint green edges. The claw tip is
  precisely tapping checkboxes on a large floating holographic to-do list in
  the center of the frame. The checklist shows five analytics tasks with
  green checkmarks appearing as the claw taps each one: Pull Google Ads data
  checked, Merge Meta campaigns checked, Build attribution report checked,
  Optimize budget allocation checked, Generate executive summary being
  checked right now with a mint green glow around it. Each completed task
  has a small green checkmark. The checklist floats on a translucent dark
  panel with subtle violet border glow. Behind the checklist, faint
  holographic dashboard screens show the actual completed work — charts,
  graphs, reports already done. The claw works with surgical precision.
  Dramatic violet lighting from behind. At the very bottom center, a bright
  hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says Book a Demo
  with pink glow. Task checklist composition, satisfying completion energy.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Bold vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story format on
  deep dark purple background. At the very top center, the word Open in
  white geometric sans-serif text with a bold red diagonal strikethrough
  line crossing it out, next to it Private in large bold bright mint green
  text then Claw in large bold white text. Below, smaller elegant light gray
  mixed-case text that says Your data. Your rules. Your agent. not all
  capitals. The frame shows a massive robotic crab claw entering from the
  top right corner of the frame, reaching diagonally down across the entire
  vertical space. The claw is dark purple metallic with glowing violet
  circuit veins and bright mint green edges. The claw is dragging and
  rearranging multiple floating holographic analytics screens like a hand
  organizing cards on a desk. It is actively moving a Google Analytics
  traffic dashboard from the upper area down to a neat grid arrangement in
  the center. Already organized in the grid: a Meta Ads performance panel,
  a revenue report with big dollar numbers, a campaign funnel chart, and a
  marketing ROI scorecard. One more screen showing budget tracker waits to
  be placed. The claw moves with confident purpose, organizing chaos into
  order. Faint motion blur trails on the screen being moved. The organized
  grid glows with a unified mint green border suggesting they are now
  connected. Dark background with violet ambient light. At the very bottom
  center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that
  says Book a Demo with pink glow. Organizing hand composition, chaos to
  order transformation.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Cinematic vertical story advertisement in tall 9:16 format on deep
  dark purple background. At the very top center, the word Open in white
  geometric sans-serif text with a bold red diagonal strikethrough line
  crossing it out, next to it Private in large bold bright mint green text
  then Claw in large bold white text. Below, smaller elegant light gray
  mixed-case text that says Your data. Your rules. Your agent. not all
  capitals. The frame is split into a dramatic before and after composition.
  In the upper half, scattered messy floating analytics screens, disconnected
  dashboards, broken charts, error messages, red warning icons, tangled data
  streams — total marketing analytics chaos fading to gray and dim. A bold
  glowing horizontal divider line in mint green separates the two halves.
  In the lower half, one powerful robotic crab claw holds everything
  together beautifully. The claw is dark purple metallic with glowing violet
  circuit veins and bright mint green edges, gripping a perfectly organized
  unified analytics dashboard that combines Google Analytics, Meta Ads,
  revenue data, campaign performance, and executive KPIs into one clean
  beautiful holographic screen glowing with colorful data visualizations.
  The claw presents it proudly. The contrast between chaos above and order
  below is stark and compelling. Dramatic violet lighting on the claw.
  Floating data particles transitioning from gray above to bright below.
  At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold
  white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Before and after split
  composition, transformation story, powerful contrast.
