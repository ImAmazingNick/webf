## Visual Philosophy: Crab Squad + Mega Crab

Three variations: 5 mini crabs each grabbing something specific (3 grab
platforms — Google Ads, Meta, Salesforce; 2 grab reports — revenue report,
campaign performance) and one massive mega crab commanding them all from
behind or above. Different compositions and angles for each.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Open Claw for Marketing
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading,
  duplicate logos, repeated platforms
- prompt: Epic dramatic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story
  format on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold
  clean white geometric sans-serif text that says Open Claw for Marketing.
  Below the headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular
  weight that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights.
  with periods not all capitals. The scene shows exactly five small robotic
  crabs in a V-formation in the lower half of the frame, each carrying
  something different. The front left crab grips a glowing Google Ads
  dashboard in its claws. The front right crab carries a Meta Ads campaign
  screen. The middle crab holds a Salesforce CRM pipeline panel. The back
  left crab carries a glowing revenue attribution report with charts. The
  back right crab carries a campaign performance report with bar graphs.
  Each mini crab is dark purple metallic with violet circuit veins and mint
  green claw tips. Behind and towering above them all, a massive mega crab
  three times their size stands as their commander, dark purple metallic
  with heavy armor, blazing mint green eyes and claws, violet circuit veins
  glowing intensely. The mega crab has both enormous claws raised wide,
  projecting a holographic unified dashboard above its head that combines
  all the data the mini crabs carry into one master view. Volumetric violet
  light from behind the mega crab. Glossy dark reflective floor. Dramatic
  scale contrast between mini and mega crabs. At the very bottom center, a
  bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says Book a
  Demo with pink glow. V-formation squad composition, clear hierarchy,
  military precision meets data unification.

## Variant 2

- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading,
  duplicate logos, repeated platforms
- prompt: Cinematic vertical story advertisement in tall 9:16 format on deep
  dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold clean white
  geometric sans-serif text that says Open Claw for Marketing. Below the
  headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight
  that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with
  periods not all capitals. The frame shows a dramatic scene from above
  looking down at a circular arrangement. In the center, one enormous mega
  robotic crab sits on a glowing platform, massive and imposing with dark
  purple heavy armor, blazing violet circuit veins, and bright mint green
  glowing claws and eyes. Around the mega crab in a circle, five smaller
  robotic crabs are positioned like points of a star, each one pushing a
  glowing holographic screen toward the center mega crab. The crab at 12
  o'clock pushes a Google Ads dashboard. The crab at 2 o'clock pushes a
  Meta Ads screen. The crab at 5 o'clock pushes a Salesforce CRM panel.
  The crab at 7 o'clock pushes a glowing revenue report with pie charts.
  The crab at 10 o'clock pushes a campaign performance report with line
  graphs. Glowing data streams flow from each small crab screen toward the
  mega crab center like spokes of a wheel. The mega crab absorbs all data,
  its shell glowing brighter where data arrives. Dark glossy floor with
  violet reflections. Overhead dramatic lighting. At the very bottom center,
  a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says
  Book a Demo with pink glow. Circular convergence composition, star
  formation, data flowing to center.

## Variant 3

  says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with periods
  not all capitals. The frame shows five small robotic crabs scaling up the
  body of one colossal mega crab like tiny workers on a giant machine. The
  mega crab fills the entire vertical frame, towering and immense, dark
  purple metallic with massive armor plates and glowing violet circuit veins.
  On the mega crab left claw, one mini crab is placing a glowing Google Ads
  screen. On the right claw, another mini crab installs a Meta Ads dashboard.
  On the chest armor, a mini crab mounts a Salesforce CRM panel. On the
  left shoulder, a mini crab attaches a revenue report screen. On the right
  shoulder, a mini crab connects a campaign performance report. Each mini
  crab is dark purple with mint green claw tips, working together to equip
  the mega crab with all marketing intelligence. The mega crab eyes glow
  brighter mint green as each screen is connected, powering up. Glowing
  data lines connect each installed screen to the mega crab central core.
  Dramatic upward perspective looking up at the mega crab. Violet volumetric
  light and floating data particles. At the very bottom center, a bright hot
  pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says Book a Demo with
  pink glow. Giant mech assembly composition, teamwork powering the titan,
  dramatic scale.
