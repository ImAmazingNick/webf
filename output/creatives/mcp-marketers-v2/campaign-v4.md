## Visual Philosophy: Characters and Machines

Upgrade: characters with personality, not corporate portraits. The three
marketers become stylized premium 3D-rendered characters — think Pixar
meets cyberpunk, each with a distinctive glowing helmet or cap that has
a character face/emblem, like mascots for the AI-powered marketer. The
terminal becomes a massive cinematic holographic MCP interface suspended
in space with protocol indicators and dramatic particle effects.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: MCP for *Marketers*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur, flat, 2D
- prompt: Cinematic studio shot of three premium stylized 3D character
  mascots standing together facing camera in a dark cinematic environment.
  Each character is a friendly anthropomorphic robot-like marketing mascot
  with a round smooth head and expressive glowing eyes, wearing a
  distinctive oversized dark purple knit beanie hat with a small glowing
  emblem on the front — one has a tiny bar chart icon, one has a tiny
  megaphone icon, one has a tiny target icon, all emblems glowing in
  bright mint green. Each character wears a dark purple hoodie over a
  sleek dark suit. They have friendly confident poses — arms crossed,
  thumbs up, one pointing upward. Each character has a thin luminous
  violet energy line extending upward from the emblem on their hat,
  all three lines converging at a bright mint green glowing nexus point
  at the top center of the image. The characters are premium quality
  3D renders with subsurface scattering on the smooth material of their
  faces, cinematic rim lighting in violet from behind. Deep dark purple
  near-black environment with subtle volumetric haze. Bold clean
  geometric Raleway-style sans-serif white text that says MCP for
  Marketers in upper area. A bright mint green rounded pill button
  with bold dark text that says Book a Demo at bottom center. Premium
  3D character design like Pixar short film meets Apple advertising.
  Meticulously crafted, exhibition-grade.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: MCP *Handles the Busywork*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur
- prompt: Dramatic cinematic wide shot of a massive holographic terminal
  interface floating in deep dark purple space at a dramatic angle. The
  terminal is enormous, taking up most of the frame, with a sleek
  transparent glass frame and subtle violet neon edge lighting pulsing
  along its borders. At the top of the terminal screen, a glowing status
  bar reads MCP Protocol Active in small bright mint green text with a
  pulsing green dot indicator. Below the status bar, three completed task
  rows with large bright mint green checkmark circles on the left, each
  followed by clean white text. First row checkmark then text Cross-channel
  attribution mapped. Second row checkmark then text Budget rebalanced
  across 12 channels. Third row checkmark then text Executive deck
  generated and sent. Below the tasks, a command prompt line showing a
  blinking mint green cursor with tiny text ready for next instruction.
  Around the terminal, hundreds of tiny luminous data particles in violet
  and white drift through the void like fireflies, some streaming into
  the terminal from all directions representing data flowing in. The
  terminal emits dramatic volumetric light beams outward into the
  surrounding deep purple darkness. Below, a glossy dark reflective floor
  shows the terminal reflection. Bold clean geometric Raleway-style
  sans-serif white text that says MCP Handles the Busywork in upper
  center. A bright mint green rounded pill button with bold dark text
  that says Book a Demo at bottom center. Sense of massive scale and
  quiet automation. Premium sci-fi advertising like Blade Runner meets
  Linear campaigns. Ultra-detailed, pristine execution.
