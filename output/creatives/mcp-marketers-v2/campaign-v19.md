  gray mixed-case text that says Your data. Your rules. Your agent. not all
  capitals. On the right side of the frame, a massive robotic crab claw
  reaching from the right edge, dark purple metallic with glowing violet
  circuit veins and bright mint green edges. The claw is tapping checkboxes
  on a floating holographic task checklist. The checklist shows five
  analytics tasks with green checkmarks: Pull Google Ads data checked, Merge
  Meta campaigns checked, Build attribution report checked, Optimize budget
  checked, Generate executive summary being checked now with mint glow.
  Behind the checklist, faint holographic dashboards show completed work.

  that says Your data. Your rules. Your agent. not all capitals. Below the
  text, spanning the full width, a dramatic scene of one massive robotic
  crab claw reaching from the left side of the frame, dark purple metallic
  with glowing violet circuit veins and bright mint green edges. The claw
  is dragging a Google Analytics dashboard from the left toward the center
  where three other dashboards are already neatly arranged: Meta Ads
  performance, revenue attribution report, campaign funnel. The claw
  organizes scattered data into a clean row. Faint motion blur trail on the
  screen being moved. The organized dashboards glow with a unified mint
  green border. Dark background with violet ambient light. At the bottom

  analytics dashboards, broken charts, red error warnings, tangled data
  streams, dim and gray — total analytics chaos. Center of frame has a
  massive robotic crab claw acting as a divider, dark purple metallic with
  glowing violet circuit veins and bright mint green edges, positioned
  vertically like a wall between chaos and order. Right third shows
  beautifully organized unified analytics — clean Google Analytics dashboard,
  Meta Ads performance, revenue report, campaign KPIs, all glowing with
  colorful data in a neat arrangement. Above the scene, the word Open in
  white text with a bold red strikethrough, then Private in bright mint
  green then Claw in white. Below, smaller light gray text that says Your

  bold white. Below, smaller light gray mixed-case text that says Your data.
  Your rules. Your agent. not all capitals. The wide frame shows two massive
  robotic crab claws entering from both the left and right edges of the
  frame, meeting in the center. Each claw is dark purple metallic with
  glowing violet circuit veins and bright mint green edges. The left claw
  holds a Google Analytics traffic dashboard. The right claw holds a Meta
  Ads campaign screen. Between the two claws in the center, they are
  merging both screens into one unified holographic dashboard that combines
  all the data with a bright mint green glow at the merge point. Data
  streams flow from both screens into the unified center view. The merge
  creates a burst of mint green energy particles. Dark atmospheric
  background with violet volumetric light from below. At the bottom center,
  a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says
  Book a Demo. Dual claw merge composition, data unification moment.

  thirds of the frame, a dramatic close-up of one massive robotic crab claw
  seen from the side, open wide, cradling inside its grip a complete
  analytics command center — five holographic screens arranged in a semicircle
  inside the claw like a cockpit. Screens show Google Analytics overview,
  Meta Ads performance, revenue attribution funnel, campaign ROI metrics,
  and executive KPI summary. All screens glow with colorful data casting
  light reflections on the inner claw surfaces. The claw is dark purple
  metallic with extreme detail, glowing violet circuit veins, bright mint
  green razor edges. The claw protectively holds all analytics like precious
  cargo. Violet atmospheric lighting and floating data particles. At the
  bottom right, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text
