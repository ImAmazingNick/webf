- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,

  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Stunning square 1:1 advertisement on deep dark purple background.
  Top center, Open in white with thin red strikethrough, below Private in
  large bold mint green then Claw in white geometric sans-serif. Small gray
  text Your data. Your rules. Your agent. Center of frame, a single
  magnificent robotic crab claw in three-quarter view, dark brushed purple
  metal with hairline violet circuit traces and bright mint green edge glow.
  The claw is open wide and between its tips it cradles a small perfect
  holographic cube of data showing tiny analytics charts on each face,
  glowing with soft multicolor light. Vast dark empty space. Single dramatic
  key light from upper left. Shallow depth of field. At bottom center,
  small hot pink pill button Book a Demo. Product photography quality.

## Variant 2
