## Visual Philosophy: Kaiju Crab Stories

Vertical 9:16 story format versions of the kaiju crab guardian. The tall
format gives room for dramatic low-angle shots with the crab towering
upward. All text rendered by Grok: headline at top, subheading below,
pink CTA button at bottom. Two different angles on the same kaiju concept.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Deploy *the Claws*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, duplicate logos,
  repeated icons
- prompt: Epic dramatic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story
  format on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold
  clean white geometric sans-serif text that says Deploy the Claws. Below
  the headline, smaller subtle gray uppercase text that says OPEN CLAW · MCP
  INSIDE. Filling the center and lower portion, a dramatic extreme low-angle
  hero shot looking straight up at a massive giant robotic crab towering
  overhead filling most of the vertical frame. The giant crab is an imposing
  premium dark purple metallic kaiju-style robot with heavy armor plates,
  glowing violet circuit veins pulsing across its entire body, and enormous
  claws with bright mint green glowing edges raised dramatically upward
  toward the top of the frame against a dark sky. Its eyes glow intense
  bright mint green. Below the giant crab at the bottom of the frame, a tiny
  miniature glowing cityscape made of floating marketing platform buildings —
  small Google Ads tower at 10 o'clock position, Meta headquarters at 12,
  Salesforce building at 2 o'clock — each building glowing with data. The
  crab is protectively standing over the city like a guardian kaiju. Dramatic
  upward volumetric light beams in violet from the city illuminating the crab
  from below. Atmospheric haze and tiny luminous data particles floating in
  the air. At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button
  with bold white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Ultra tall
  vertical composition, movie poster grandeur, awe-inspiring towering scale.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Claws *Deployed*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, duplicate logos,
  repeated icons
- prompt: Cinematic vertical story advertisement in tall 9:16 format on deep
  dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold clean white
  geometric sans-serif text that says Claws Deployed. Below the headline,
  smaller subtle gray uppercase text that says YOUR DATA GUARDIAN · MCP
  POWERED. The full vertical frame shows a towering giant robotic crab kaiju
  seen from a dramatic side angle, mid-stride, moving through a canyon of
  glowing holographic marketing dashboards that line both sides of the frame
  like a futuristic city street. The crab is a massive dark purple metallic
  robot with thick heavy armor, glowing violet circuit veins across every
  surface, bright mint green glowing claw edges and eyes. The crab's right
  claw reaches forward gripping a large holographic Google Analytics dashboard
  panel while the left claw holds a Meta Ads performance screen. Along both
  sides of the canyon, tall floating holographic screens show Salesforce CRM
  at left, HubSpot pipeline at right, budget allocation charts, campaign
  performance graphs — all casting colorful light reflections on the crab's
  armor. The ground is a glossy dark reflective surface with violet light
  trails where the crab has walked. Volumetric god rays stream down from
  above in violet. Tiny floating data particles fill the air like fireflies.
  At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold
  white text that says Book a Demo with glowing pink aura. Towering vertical
  composition, each dashboard screen detailed, cinematic kaiju movie poster.
