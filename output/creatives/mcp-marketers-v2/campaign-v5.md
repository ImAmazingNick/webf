## Visual Philosophy: Spectral Convergence

Radical simplicity. One object. One metaphor. No dashboards, no terminals,
no characters, no floating logos. Just a single impossibly beautiful crystal
prism floating in void — scattered colored light entering from every
direction, passing through the prism, exiting as one pure unified beam.
MCP IS the prism: many protocols in, one standard out. The elegance is in
what's NOT there. Cinematic, gallery-worthy, the kind of image that stops
a scroll because it's beautiful, not because it's busy.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: One Protocol. *Pure Signal.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  text artifacts, cluttered, busy, dashboards, screens, people, logos
- prompt: Extreme close-up studio photography of a single large perfectly
  cut geometric crystal prism floating weightlessly in a vast deep dark
  purple void. From the left side of the frame, dozens of thin scattered
  light beams in different colors — white, soft blue, pale orange, light
  green, faint red — enter the prism from various angles, representing
  fragmented data sources. Inside the crystal, the light refracts and
  converges beautifully, visible through the transparent crystal surface
  with stunning internal caustics and rainbow refractions. From the right
  side of the prism, a single powerful concentrated beam of bright mint
  green light exits cleanly, cutting through the dark void with volumetric
  atmosphere and subtle dust particles visible in the beam. The crystal
  surface is flawless with subtle violet reflections from the deep purple
  environment. Sharp edge highlights in violet where light catches the
  crystal facets. The prism casts delicate caustic light patterns on an
  invisible surface below. Shallow depth of field with the crystal
  perfectly sharp and the background dissolving into soft dark bokeh.
  Bold clean geometric Raleway-style white sans-serif text that says
  One Protocol. Pure Signal. in upper center. A bright mint green
  rounded pill button with bold dark text that says Book a Demo at
  bottom center. Sense of perfect clarity emerging from complexity.
  Premium product photography like Apple Pro Display campaign meets
  high-end jewelry advertising. Museum-quality composition, pristine
  execution, every facet placed with precision.
