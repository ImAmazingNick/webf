## Visual Philosophy: The Claw Awakens

Open Claw meets MCP — a fun, bold, memorable creative. Giant stylized
robotic crab claws as the hero visual, manipulating marketing tools with
precision and playfulness. Premium but fun — Pixar meets cyberpunk. The
crab claws are the mascot, MCP is the protocol. All text by Grok.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Open Claw *for Marketing*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, water, beach
- prompt: Fun and bold cinematic advertisement on deep dark purple near-black
  background. At the top center, large bold clean white geometric sans-serif
  text that says Open Claw for Marketing. Directly below the headline,
  smaller subtle gray uppercase text that says POWERED BY MCP. In the center
  of the frame, two giant stylized premium robotic crab claws emerging from
  the darkness, sleek and futuristic with a polished dark purple metallic
  surface and glowing bright violet accent lines running along the edges
  like circuit traces. The claw tips glow bright mint green. The left claw
  is gently holding a floating holographic Google Ads dashboard interface
  glowing in violet. The right claw is precisely manipulating a floating
  Meta Ads campaign panel. Between the two claws, small floating marketing
  platform logos — Salesforce, HubSpot, TikTok, LinkedIn — orbit in a
  loose circle, each connected by thin luminous violet threads to both
  claws. The claws have a premium toy-like quality, fun but sophisticated,
  like a high-end collectible figure. Dramatic volumetric lighting from
  below casting violet light upward onto the claws. Subtle particle
  effects and tiny data sparkles drifting around the claws. Below, a
  glossy dark reflective surface showing the claw reflections. At the
  bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white
  text that says Book a Demo with a soft glowing pink shadow. Premium
  3D advertising like Pixar short film meets Apple product launch.
  Meticulously crafted, exhibition-grade, every mechanical detail precise.
