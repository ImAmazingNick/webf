## Visual Philosophy: Open Claw Encore

Three more totally unique kaiju crab stories. Pushing even wilder concepts:
an army of mini crabs, a crab DJ, and a crab astronaut. Same headline and
subheading, all text by Grok. Pink button. YEEEHAAA!

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Open Claw for Marketing
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, duplicate logos,
  repeated icons, all caps subheading
- prompt: Epic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story format on
  deep dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold clean white
  geometric sans-serif text that says Open Claw for Marketing. Below the
  headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight that
  says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with periods
  not all capitals. The frame shows a massive commander robotic kaiju crab
  standing tall at the center back, with an army of dozens of smaller mini
  robotic crabs marching forward toward the viewer in perfect formation like
  a military parade. The commander crab is huge, dark purple metallic with
  glowing violet circuit veins and bright mint green glowing claws and eyes,
  standing behind its army. Each mini crab is a smaller identical robot with
  purple armor and mint green claw tips, each one carrying a different
  glowing holographic item — one carries a Google Ads logo, another a Meta
  logo, another a Salesforce dashboard, another a revenue chart, another a
  campaign brief. They march in rows along a glossy dark reflective floor
  that stretches toward the viewer. Dramatic violet fog at ground level.
  Volumetric light beams from behind the commander crab creating a dramatic
  silhouette backlight. The scene feels like an unstoppable data army
  advancing. At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill
  button with bold white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Military
  march composition, army aesthetic, overwhelming force.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Open Claw for Marketing
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, duplicate logos,
  repeated icons, all caps subheading
- prompt: Fun bold vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story format
  on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold clean
  white geometric sans-serif text that says Open Claw for Marketing. Below
  the headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight
  that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with
  periods not all capitals. The frame shows a robotic kaiju crab behind a
  massive futuristic DJ booth, spinning holographic turntables made of
  marketing dashboards. The crab is dark purple metallic with glowing violet
  circuit veins, bright mint green claws and eyes, wearing a pair of
  oversized neon headphones glowing violet. Its two claws work the DJ
  decks — the left claw scratching a turntable that displays a spinning
  Google Analytics dashboard, the right claw adjusting faders on a mixing
  board made of campaign performance sliders showing CTR, ROAS, CPA dials.
  Behind the crab, a massive wall of stacked holographic screens showing
  live marketing data visualizations pulsing to an imaginary beat. Colorful
  equalizer bars of violet and mint green rise and fall. Laser beams shoot
  outward from the booth in violet and mint. The booth has glowing text
  that says MCP on the front panel. Crowd energy atmosphere with floating
  data particles like confetti. At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink
  rounded pill button with bold white text that says Book a Demo with pink
  glow. Festival DJ composition, fun party energy meets enterprise tech.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Open Claw for Marketing
- cta: Book a Demo

- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, duplicate logos,
  repeated icons, all caps subheading
- prompt: Breathtaking vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story
  format on deep dark purple space background with distant stars. At the
  very top center, large bold clean white geometric sans-serif text that
  says Open Claw for Marketing. Below the headline, smaller elegant light
  gray mixed-case text in regular weight that says One agent grabs it all.
  Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with periods not all capitals. The frame
  shows a robotic kaiju crab floating majestically in outer space, wearing
  a sleek futuristic astronaut helmet with a transparent visor showing its
  bright mint green glowing eyes inside. The crab is dark purple metallic
  with glowing violet circuit veins, floating weightlessly with claws
  extended. Around the crab, instead of planets, large spherical orbs orbit
  like a solar system — each orb is a different marketing platform globe
  with its logo on the surface: a Google Ads planet, a Meta planet, a
  Salesforce planet, a HubSpot planet, a TikTok planet. Glowing data
  streams connect each planet to the crab like orbital rings. The crab
  floats at the center of this marketing solar system. Behind everything,
  a beautiful nebula in deep violet and purple tones with mint green star
  clusters. Tiny astronaut data particles float around. At the very bottom
  center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that
  says Book a Demo with pink glow. Space exploration composition, cosmic
  grandeur, marketing universe aesthetic.
