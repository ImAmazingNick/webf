## Visual Philosophy: MCP Gateway

MCP as the universal gateway. On one side, fragmented marketing chaos.
Through the gateway, unified intelligence. All text rendered by Grok —
headline, MCP subheading, and hot pink CTA button. The visual IS the ad.
Agent HTML only adds the SVG logo.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Your AI Speaks *Marketing*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  duplicate text, repeated words
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement on deep dark purple near-black background.
  At the top center, bold clean geometric white sans-serif text that says
  Your AI Speaks Marketing with generous letter spacing. Directly below
  the headline, smaller subtle light gray uppercase text that says
  POWERED BY MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL with wide letter spacing. Below
  the text, a stunning luminous brain structure made of thousands of thin
  glowing violet and mint green neural pathways floating in the center of
  the frame. The brain is translucent and radiant. On the left side,
  small recognizable marketing platform logos — Google Ads, Meta, HubSpot,
  Salesforce — float inward, each connected to the brain by thin luminous
  violet data streams feeding into it. On the right side of the brain,
  holographic outputs materialize — a small dashboard chart, a report
  page, an upward arrow — emerging from the brain in bright mint green,
  representing intelligence and actions. The brain glows brightest at its
  core where all inputs converge and outputs emerge. Eight small clean
  white labels orbit the brain connected by thin threads — ROAS at
  10 o clock, CAC at 12 o clock, LTV at 2 o clock, Attribution at
  3 o clock, Pipeline at 4 o clock, CTR at 6 o clock, Conversions at
  8 o clock, Impressions at 9 o clock. Volumetric light radiating
  outward from the brain core. Below the brain, a glossy dark reflective
  surface with subtle caustic light patterns. At the bottom center, a
  bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says
  Book a Demo with a soft pink glow shadow around the button. Premium
  neuroscience meets enterprise tech advertising like DeepMind or
  Anthropic campaigns. Museum-quality composition, pristine execution,
  every neural pathway placed with intention.
