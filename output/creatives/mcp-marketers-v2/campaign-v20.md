## Visual Philosophy: Private Claw — Clean & Elegant

Five minimalist LinkedIn landscapes. Less detail, more negative space,
more elegance. One claw, clean background, subtle dashboards. The claw
itself is the star — no clutter. Breathe. All text by Grok.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, too many elements, noisy,
  all caps subheading, full body crab, multiple crabs, multiple dashboards
- prompt: Clean minimalist wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on
  deep dark purple background with lots of empty negative space. On the left
  side, the word Open in white geometric sans-serif text with a clean red
  strikethrough line, below it Private in large bold bright mint green text
  then Claw in large bold white text. Below, small elegant light gray text
  that says Your data. Your rules. Your agent. On the right side, a single
  elegant robotic crab claw emerging from the right edge, dark purple
  metallic with subtle violet circuit veins and bright mint green edges.
  The claw delicately holds one single clean holographic analytics dashboard
  screen. The dashboard is minimal and beautiful with a few clean chart
  lines and key metrics. Vast empty dark purple space surrounds the claw
  giving it room to breathe. Soft violet ambient glow. No clutter. No extra
  elements. Just the claw and one screen. At bottom right, a small bright
  hot pink pill button with white text Book a Demo. Gallery-level minimalism,
  elegant restraint, premium brand feel.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, too many elements, noisy,
  all caps subheading, full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Elegant minimalist wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on
  deep dark purple gradient background fading to near black at edges. Center
  of frame, the word Open in white text with a thin red strikethrough line,
  next to it Private in bright mint green then Claw in white, all in clean
  geometric sans-serif. Below, small light gray text Your data. Your rules.
  Your agent. Below the text, a single robotic crab claw tip visible at the
  bottom of frame, just the very tip reaching up elegantly, dark purple
  metallic with a bright mint green glowing edge. The claw tip gently
  touches a single small floating holographic card showing a simple revenue
  number with a small upward arrow. Everything else is vast empty dark
  space. Extremely minimal. The claw is barely there, just a hint. Soft
  violet glow around the claw tip only. At bottom center, a small bright
  hot pink pill button with white text Book a Demo. Ultra minimal, barely
  there, whisper-quiet elegance.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, too many elements, noisy,
  all caps subheading, full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Refined minimalist wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on
  smooth deep dark purple background. Left third has clean text: the word
  Open in white with a red strikethrough, below it Private in bright mint
  green then Claw in white geometric sans-serif. Below, small light gray
  text Your data. Your rules. Your agent. Right two thirds shows one
  beautiful robotic crab claw in profile silhouette, dark purple metallic
  catching soft violet rim light along its edge, bright mint green glow on
  the claw tips only. The claw is open and relaxed, not gripping anything
  aggressively. Between the open claw tips, a soft glowing mint green orb
  of light floats, representing unified data — abstract and beautiful. No
  dashboards, no screens, just pure light. Clean empty space everywhere.
  Soft shallow depth of field. At bottom right, a small bright hot pink
  pill button with white text Book a Demo. Abstract and poetic, light as
  data metaphor, gallery minimalism.

## Variant 4
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, too many elements, noisy,
  all caps subheading, full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Sleek minimalist wide landscape advertisement in 16:9 format on
  deep dark purple background. Center composition. At top center, the word
  Open in white with a clean red strikethrough, next to it Private in bright
  mint green then Claw in white clean geometric sans-serif. Below, small
  light gray text Your data. Your rules. Your agent. Below the text in the
  center, one robotic crab claw viewed from directly above, laying flat on
  a dark glossy reflective surface. The claw is dark purple metallic with
  subtle violet veins and bright mint green edges, perfectly symmetrical
  and beautiful like a product photo. Next to the claw, three small clean
  holographic icons float slightly above the surface: a simple chart icon,
  a simple report icon, a simple dashboard icon, each glowing faintly in
  violet. The glossy surface reflects the claw and icons perfectly. Vast
  empty space. Studio product photography lighting, soft and even. At
  bottom center, a small bright hot pink pill button with white text Book
  a Demo. Product shot minimalism, Apple-style clean, studio quality.

## Variant 5
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, cluttered, busy, too many elements, noisy,
  all caps subheading, full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Sophisticated minimalist wide landscape advertisement in 16:9
  format on deep dark purple background. On the far left, clean text stack:
  the word Open in white with a red strikethrough, below Private in large
  bright mint green then Claw in white geometric sans-serif. Below, small
  light gray text Your data. Your rules. Your agent. On the far right, a
  single robotic crab claw emerging from the right edge, dark purple
  metallic with bright mint green edges. The claw holds a single thin
  glowing line that stretches horizontally across the entire width of the
  frame from the claw tip to the text, connecting them. The line pulses
  with mint green energy and has three small nodes along its length, each
  node a tiny glowing dot representing a data source. The line is the only
  element connecting text and claw across vast empty dark space. Minimal
  and conceptual. Soft violet ambient glow. At bottom center, a small
  bright hot pink pill button with white text Book a Demo. Connected line
  composition, conceptual elegance, vast negative space.
