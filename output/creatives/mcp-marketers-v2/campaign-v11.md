## Visual Philosophy: Kaiju OpenClaw Trilogy

Three towering kaiju crab stories — same headline "OpenClaw for Marketing",
same subheading, but three wildly different dramatic compositions. Each
crab dominates the vertical frame with cinematic grandeur. All text rendered
by Grok: headline, mixed-case subheading, pink button.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: OpenClaw for Marketing
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, duplicate logos,
  repeated icons, all caps subheading
- prompt: Epic dramatic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story
  format on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold
  clean white geometric sans-serif text that says OpenClaw for Marketing.
  Below the headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular
  weight that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights.
  with periods between each word not all capitals. Filling the center of the
  frame, a colossal robotic kaiju crab facing directly toward the viewer in
  a powerful frontal hero pose. The crab is a magnificent dark purple
  metallic robot with heavy layered armor plates, intricate glowing violet
  circuit veins pulsing across its entire shell and legs, and two massive
  claws raised wide open with bright mint green glowing razor edges. Its
  eyes burn intense bright mint green. The crab is standing on a glossy
  dark reflective platform surrounded by a semicircle of tall floating
  holographic marketing dashboards — Google Analytics showing 1.4M sessions
  at 10 o'clock, Meta Ads showing $380K spend at 12, Salesforce pipeline at
  2 o'clock — each screen casting colorful reflections onto the crab armor.
  Between the claws, streams of glowing data particles flow inward toward
  the crab like it is absorbing all marketing data. Dramatic volumetric
  violet light from below. Atmospheric purple haze. At the very bottom
  center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that
  says Book a Demo with pink glow. Towering vertical composition, premium
  3D Pixar-meets-Pacific-Rim quality, awe-inspiring scale.

  dark purple background. At the very top center, large bold clean white
  geometric sans-serif text that says OpenClaw for Marketing. Below the
  headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight
  that says One agent grabs it all. Campaigns. Reports. Insights. with
  periods not all capitals. The vertical frame shows a breathtaking overhead
  birds-eye shot looking down at a massive robotic kaiju crab from above.
  The crab is sprawled across the center of the frame with all eight legs
  extended outward like a star, each leg tip touching a different glowing
  holographic marketing platform node — Google Ads node glowing blue at top,
  Meta node glowing blue-purple at upper right, Salesforce node green at
  right, HubSpot node orange at lower right, TikTok node cyan at bottom,
  LinkedIn node blue at lower left, analytics node violet at left, CRM node
  mint at upper left. The crab is dark purple metallic with glowing violet
  circuit veins and bright mint green glowing claws and eyes visible from
  above. Between each leg, streams of luminous data flow along glowing
  pathways from each platform toward the crab center like a neural network.
  The entire scene looks like a massive glowing circuit board from above
  with the crab as the central processor. Dark glossy background with faint
  grid lines. At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill
  button with bold white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow aura.
  Overhead drone-shot composition, data-network aesthetic, every connection
  precise and detailed.

  with periods not all capitals. The frame shows a spectacular side profile
  shot of a massive robotic kaiju crab climbing vertically up a tower of
  stacked glowing holographic marketing dashboards like a skyscraper. The
  crab is ascending from bottom to top of the frame, clinging to the tower
  with its legs, one enormous claw reaching upward grabbing the next
  dashboard screen. The crab is dark purple metallic with thick heavy armor,
  glowing violet circuit veins across every surface, bright mint green
  glowing claw edges and piercing mint green eyes looking upward. The tower
  of dashboards shows from bottom to top: campaign budget at base, Meta Ads
  performance, Google Analytics traffic, Salesforce CRM deals, executive
  revenue report at the very top glowing brightest. Each dashboard screen
  has distinct data visualizations and colorful charts. The crab leaves a
  trail of glowing violet energy as it climbs. Dramatic side lighting in
  violet from the left. Tiny floating data particles like embers rising
  upward around the crab. Dark atmospheric background. At the very bottom
  center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold white text that
  says Book a Demo with pink glow. Vertical climbing composition perfectly
  utilizing the tall format, cinematic action movie energy, every dashboard
  screen detailed.
