## Visual Philosophy: Private Claw

The word Open is crossed out with a red strikethrough line and replaced
with Private above or next to it. One crab claw reaching in grabbing
analytics dashboards and tasks. Edgy, rebellious, scroll-stopping.
All text by Grok.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Bold dramatic vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story
  format on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, a clever
  text treatment showing the word Open in white geometric sans-serif text
  with a bold red diagonal strikethrough line crossing it out, and directly
  next to it the word Private in large bold bright mint green geometric
  sans-serif text, followed by the word Claw in large bold white text. So
  the full headline reads as Open crossed out then Private Claw. Below the
  headline, smaller elegant light gray mixed-case text in regular weight
  that says Your data. Your rules. Your agent. with periods not all
  capitals. The main visual shows one massive robotic crab claw reaching
  dramatically from the right side of the frame, dark purple metallic with
  glowing violet circuit veins and bright mint green razor edges. The claw
  is grabbing and pulling a large glowing Google Analytics dashboard screen
  toward itself. The dashboard shows detailed traffic data, session graphs,
  user metrics, conversion funnels. Around the claw, several smaller
  floating holographic task cards are being swiped and collected — cards
  showing completed checkmarks next to tasks like campaign optimization,
  budget allocation, performance report. The claw is taking over all the
  analytics work. On the left side of the frame, faint ghosted outlines of
  the same dashboards and tasks suggest they used to be scattered and
  unmanaged before the claw grabbed them. Dramatic violet rim lighting on
  the claw. Dark atmospheric background with floating data particles. At
  the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill button with bold
  white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Single claw takeover
  composition, rebellious energy, private and powerful.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Cinematic vertical story advertisement in tall 9:16 format on deep
  dark purple background. At the very top center, a bold text treatment
  where the word Open appears in white geometric sans-serif text with a
  thick red strikethrough line slashed through it crossing it out completely,
  and right after it the word Private in large bold bright mint green
  geometric sans-serif text, then Claw in large bold white text. The
  headline reads Open struck through then Private Claw. Below, smaller
  elegant light gray mixed-case text that says Your data. Your rules. Your
  agent. with periods not all capitals. The frame shows a dramatic close-up
  of a single massive robotic crab claw entering from the bottom of the
  frame reaching upward, dark purple metallic with hyper-detailed armor
  plates, glowing violet circuit veins, bright mint green edges blazing. The
  claw is in the act of snatching a stack of floating holographic analytics
  screens from mid-air. The screens show Google Analytics traffic dashboard
  at front, a marketing attribution report behind it, a campaign task list
  with checkboxes being marked complete, budget tracker, KPI scorecard. The
  claw grips the entire stack possessively. Above the claw, fading ghost
  outlines of the same screens suggest they were floating freely before the
  claw claimed them. A mint green energy aura surrounds the claw grip point.
  Dramatic backlighting in violet. Shallow depth of field with the claw
  razor sharp. At the very bottom center, a bright hot pink rounded pill
  button with bold white text that says Book a Demo with pink glow. Vertical
  reach composition, one claw claims everything, possessive power.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: Private Claw
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  realistic crab, seafood, ocean, horizontal composition, all caps subheading,
  full body crab, multiple crabs
- prompt: Striking vertical cinematic advertisement in tall 9:16 story format
  on deep dark purple background. At the very top center, bold headline text
  treatment with the word Open in white geometric sans-serif crossed out with
  a bright red strikethrough slash line, then the word Private in large bold
  bright mint green geometric sans-serif, then Claw in large bold white.
  Reading as Open crossed out Private Claw. Below, smaller elegant light
  gray mixed-case text that says Your data. Your rules. Your agent. with
  periods not all capitals. The frame shows a cinematic side view of one
  enormous robotic crab claw extending horizontally across the entire width
  of the frame in the center. The claw is dark purple metallic with glowing
  violet circuit veins and bright mint green edges. The claw is open wide
  and inside its grip it holds a complete analytics command center — a
  beautiful arrangement of five holographic screens nested inside the claw
  like a portable cockpit. The screens show a Google Analytics overview at
  center, campaign performance metrics on the left screen, revenue
  attribution funnel on the right screen, a completed task checklist above,
  and a budget optimization panel below. All screens glow with colorful data
  and cast light inside the claw creating a cozy cockpit of data. The claw
  is protective, cradling all the analytics like precious cargo. Outside the
  claw, the background is dark and empty — suggesting chaos without the
  claw. Violet atmospheric lighting. At the very bottom center, a bright hot
  pink rounded pill button with bold white text that says Book a Demo with
  pink glow. Claw cockpit composition, protective data sanctuary, intimate
  and powerful.
