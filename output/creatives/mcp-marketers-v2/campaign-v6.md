## Visual Philosophy: Neural Marketing

The AI brain that natively understands marketing language. Upgraded from
v4 with cleaner execution: no duplicate labels, more dramatic lighting,
the brain as a luminous sculpture. Agent HTML adds MCP subheading and
a hot pink CTA button for scroll-stopping contrast.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Your AI Speaks *Marketing.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed, amateur,
  duplicate labels, repeated text, duplicate words
- prompt: Cinematic hero shot of a luminous translucent brain structure
  floating in deep dark purple void, made of thousands of thin glowing
  violet neural connection lines and bright nodes. The brain is large and
  centered in the frame, glowing with internal energy. Around the brain,
  exactly eight small clean white text labels orbit like satellites, each
  connected to the brain by a thin luminous thread. The eight labels are
  ROAS positioned at top-left, CAC at top-center, LTV at top-right,
  Attribution at right, Pipeline at bottom-right, CTR at bottom-center,
  Conversions at bottom-left, Impressions at left. Each label is in a
  small dark rounded tag with clean white text. One dense region of the
  brain on the right side glows bright mint green where the connections
  are thickest, suggesting deep understanding. From this mint green
  region, a burst of luminous mint green connection lines extends outward
  to the right creating a beautiful data dispersal pattern. The brain
  emits soft volumetric light upward and outward into the surrounding
  deep dark purple void. Dramatic rim lighting in violet from behind the
  brain creating a halo effect. Below, subtle caustic light reflections
  on a glossy dark surface. Bold clean geometric Raleway-style white
  sans-serif text that says Your AI Speaks Marketing in upper center of
  the image with generous spacing from the brain visual. No button in the
  image. Clean dark space at the bottom 20 percent of the image. Premium
  neuroscience meets tech advertising like DeepMind or Neuralink campaigns.
  Museum-quality composition, pristine execution.
