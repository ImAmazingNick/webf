## Visual Philosophy: Private Claw — Ultra Clean Round 3

Five more minimalist LinkedIn landscapes. Even less detail than round 2.
Think luxury brand ads — one element, vast space, perfect typography.
The claw is a luxury object. All text by Grok.

  light gray text below Your data. Your rules. Your agent. Center right of
  frame, a single robotic crab claw floating elegantly, dark matte purple
  with subtle violet accents and one bright mint green edge highlight. The
  claw is open and from between its tips, a thin stream of tiny glowing mint
  green data particles flows gently upward like smoke, dissolving into
  nothing. No dashboards. No screens. Just the claw breathing data. Vast
  empty dark space. Soft single-source lighting from above. At bottom right,

  mint green edges. Between the two claw tips they hold a single thin
  glowing holographic card, minimal and clean, showing just one number:
  4.2x ROAS in clean white text on a translucent dark card. Nothing else.
  Maximum negative space. The card floats between the tips with a soft mint
  glow. Gentle violet ambient light. At bottom center, small hot pink pill

  crab claw seen in perfect side profile silhouette against the dark
  background. The claw is closed and at rest, dark purple metallic catching
  just a thin line of violet rim light along its top edge and mint green on
  the tip. The claw casts a soft shadow below on a barely visible dark
  surface. Completely still. No action. No dashboards. Just the tool at
