## Visual Philosophy: Prismatic Assembly

Scattered light in a void — each wavelength brilliant alone, but incomplete. The visual
world lives in the physics of optical convergence: spectral bands drifting through deep
space, prismatic glass catching and bending them, the instant before all color reunites
into one coherent beam. Surfaces are optical: polished crystal edges, refractive glass
planes, caustic light patterns cast on dark matte stone. Nothing organic, nothing soft.

The palette is the phenomenon itself. Deep purple #20124d IS the void between wavelengths.
Violet #8068ff IS the spectral structure — the bands, the refractions, the edges of glass
catching light. Mint #8affbc appears once: the convergence point, the single bright reward
where scattered signals become one. The camera sits close — macro optics, shallow depth of
field, the prism filling the frame. Every composition has one subject and vast breathing
room. Meticulously crafted, as if a master optical physicist arranged each element by hand
and a Hasselblad captured it at the exact right millisecond.

## Variant 1
- layout: stat-hero
- stat: $2.4M
- headline: $2.4M saved *in year one*
- cta: See how it works
- body: Full-context AI. Not another dashboard.
- text-effect: gradient
- badge: Trusted by 40+ enterprises
- negative-prompt: text, words, letters, writing, characters, watermarks, logos, people, faces
- prompt: Extreme macro photograph of a single crystal prism refracting scattered
  violet #8068ff spectral bands into converging lines against a deep purple #20124d
  void. Caustic light patterns scatter across a dark matte obsidian surface beneath
  the prism. One bright convergence point glows mint #8affbc where all bands meet.
  Shot on Hasselblad medium format, extreme detail, shallow depth of field, studio
  rim lighting from upper-left. Pristine execution, exhibition-grade.

## Variant 2
- layout: bold-type
- headline: Developers got 10x. *Business teams are next.*
- cta: Book a demo
- text-effect: outline
- rotate: true
- negative-prompt: text, words, letters, writing, characters, watermarks, logos

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: One graph. Every signal. *Zero blind spots.*
- cta: See how it works
- body: 500+ sources. One knowledge graph. One AI agent.
- negative-prompt: text, words, letters, writing, characters, watermarks, logos, people, faces
- prompt: Dramatic 3D crystal prism floating in deep purple #20124d void, splitting
  a single beam of white light into three distinct spectral streams in violet #8068ff
  tones. The streams fan outward, each carrying different caustic patterns on the
  surrounding dark space. One faint mint #8affbc highlight at the prism's apex where
  light first enters. Studio product photography, single key light from above creating
  sharp edge highlights on the crystal facets. Vast negative space, the prism is the
  only object. Museum-quality composition, the product of deep expertise.
