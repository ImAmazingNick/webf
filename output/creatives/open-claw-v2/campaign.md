## Visual Philosophy: Geological Revelation

The moment of cracking open — dark basalt giving way to a cathedral of crystal.
The exterior is unremarkable: rough volcanic rock, almost black, with deep purple
undertones that suggest depth without delivering it. Then the fracture. And inside:
formations of amethyst so precise they look engineered, catching light that has
no business being this deep underground.

This is the Open Claw tension made physical. Your tools show you the rough exterior —
the dashboard, the single-channel metric — but the value is locked inside, visible
only when something cuts through. The camera sits inches from the crack, macro-scale,
finding geological drama in the transition from dark to luminous. One mint-bright
crystal tip marks the point of discovery.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: Your business AI is still *autocomplete.*
- cta: Meet the full-context agent
- body: 500+ sources. One knowledge graph. One AI that reasons across your entire business.
- negative-prompt: text, words, letters, writing, characters, watermarks, logos, people, faces, hands
- prompt: Extreme macro photograph of a split amethyst geode in a dark studio.
  The left side is rough dark volcanic basalt, nearly black with deep purple undertone.
  The right side reveals a cathedral of crystalline amethyst formations, sharp angular
  facets catching a single beam of warm edge light from the upper right. Crystals
  graduate from deep violet at the base to bright translucent lavender at the tips.
  One small crystal cluster at the fracture edge glows faint mint green, the brightest
  point in the entire frame. The geode crack runs diagonally from upper-left to
  lower-right, creating a natural division. Deep shadow fills the lower-left third
  of the frame, providing expansive dark negative space. Cinematic studio lighting,
  single key light from above-right, shallow depth of field, extreme detail, high
  detail rendering. Predominantly dark, 70 percent of the image is deep purple-black
  void. Pristine execution, every element placed with precision, exhibition-grade.
