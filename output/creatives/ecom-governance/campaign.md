## Visual Philosophy: Driving Blind

A $282M operation with no instruments, no speedometer, no warning
lights. The dashboard exists but nobody plugged it in. The visual
language borrows from automotive dashboards and cockpit instruments —
everything dark and inactive.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: 0 of 16 Brands. *Governed.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with stark emptiness concept. Large
  bold clean white sans-serif text that says 0 of 16 Brands. Governed.
  across the upper third, with the 0 rendered extra large and impactful.
  Below, 16 dark toggle switches arranged in two neat rows of 8 on a
  premium dark control panel surface. Every single switch is in the OFF
  position, each with a dim red indicator light. The panel looks
  expensive and well-designed but completely inactive — dormant power.
  One switch on the far right has a faint mint green glow starting to
  appear beneath it, suggesting potential activation. Dramatic overhead
  spotlight on the switches. Small bold white text that says Book a Demo
  in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark
  purple near-black background. Premium industrial design photography.
  Museum-quality composition.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: $282M Budget. *No Speedometer.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with automotive metaphor. Large bold
  clean white sans-serif text that says $282M Budget. No Speedometer.
  across the upper third. Below, a close-up of a premium luxury car
  dashboard at night, but every gauge, dial, and instrument is
  completely dark and blank — the speedometer needle at zero, the
  tachometer dead, the fuel gauge empty, no warning lights active.
  Just smooth dark glass with no information. Through the windshield,
  blurred headlights of oncoming traffic streak past suggesting high
  speed. The contrast between blind instruments and high-speed motion
  is terrifying. Faint red-amber reflection on the dashboard glass.
  Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint
  green button at bottom center. Deep dark purple tones. Cinematic
  automotive photography. Ultra-detailed, razor-sharp.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: 17 Rules Available. *Zero Active.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement showing wasted potential. Large bold
  clean white sans-serif text that says 17 Rules Available. Zero Active.
  across the upper third. Below, a dark premium server rack or circuit
  board with 17 small rectangular indicator slots arranged in a column.
  Each slot has a label etched in dim text and a status light — but
  every single light is dark, OFF, inactive. The slots look like they
  should be glowing but are dormant. Faint dust particles visible in
  a shaft of light crossing the frame. One slot at the bottom barely
  flickers with a faint mint green pulse, suggesting it could activate.
  Dramatic side lighting creating long shadows. Small bold white text
  that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom
  center. Deep dark purple background. Premium tech hardware
  photography. Pristine execution.
