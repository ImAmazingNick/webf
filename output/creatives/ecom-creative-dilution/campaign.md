## Visual Philosophy: Static vs. Signal

When the same creative runs in 3 campaigns simultaneously, the data
becomes noise. The visual language borrows from broadcast interference —
static, fragmented signals, duplicated images losing fidelity. Clean
signal on one side, pure noise on the other.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: 15% of Spend. *Zero Signal.*
- cta: Get Your Free Audit
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with broadcast interference concept.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says 15% of Spend. Zero
  Signal. across the upper third. Below, a dark premium monitor screen
  showing a advertising performance chart, but 15% of the screen on
  the right side is consumed by bright glowing TV static and visual
  noise — jagged red-amber interference lines cutting through the
  data. The clean 85% on the left shows crisp violet and mint green
  chart lines, while the noisy 15% zone is pure chaos. The boundary
  between signal and noise is sharp and dramatic. Dramatic screen glow
  illuminating the dark surroundings. Small bold white text that says
  Get Your Free Audit in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom
  center. Deep dark purple near-black background. Premium tech
  advertising. Ultra-detailed.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: Same Ad. 3 Campaigns. *No Clarity.*
- cta: Get Your Free Audit
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement showing duplication degradation. Large
  bold clean white sans-serif text that says Same Ad. 3 Campaigns. No
  Clarity. across the upper third. Below, three identical ad creative
  thumbnails floating in dark space, overlapping each other at slight
  angles like poorly aligned prints. Each copy is slightly more
  degraded and faded than the last — the first is crisp, the second
  has red-amber artifacts, the third is almost pure static. Thin lines
  connect all three to a single confused question mark icon at the
  bottom glowing in dim amber. The visual metaphor: duplication destroys
  the signal. Small bold white text that says Get Your Free Audit in
  a rounded bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark purple
  void background. Premium advertising quality. Exhibition-grade.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: $12.3M in *Diluted Signal.*
- cta: Get Your Free Audit
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with dissolving data concept. Large
  bold clean white sans-serif text that says $12.3M in Diluted Signal.
  across the upper third, with the dollar amount extra large. Below,
  a stream of bright clean data particles flowing from left to right,
  starting as organized luminous mint green data points on the left,
  but gradually scattering, dimming, and dissolving into red-amber
  noise particles on the right side — the signal literally diluting
  as it travels. The organized left side is tight and bright, the
  right side is scattered chaos. A dark grid perspective surface below.
  Small bold white text that says Get Your Free Audit in a rounded
  bright mint green button at bottom center. Deep dark purple
  background. Premium data visualization advertising. Meticulously
  crafted.
