## Visual Philosophy: The False Mirror

ACoS shows you what you want to see. TACoS shows what's actually
happening. The visual language is mirrors, reflections, split realities —
one side looks healthy, the other reveals the truth. The contrast
between comfortable illusion and uncomfortable reality.

## Variant 1
- layout: classic
- headline: 90% Track *the Wrong Metric.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic advertisement with broken compass metaphor. Large
  bold clean white sans-serif text that says 90% Track the Wrong Metric.
  across the upper third, with 90% rendered extra large and impactful.
  Below, a premium dark compass lying on a dark surface, but the
  compass needle is spinning wildly, blurred with motion — pointing
  in the wrong direction. The compass face shows metric labels instead
  of cardinal directions. A faint red-amber glow emanates from the
  spinning needle. Behind the compass, a faint mint green arrow points
  in the correct direction, barely visible — the right metric hiding
  in plain sight. Dramatic single-source overhead lighting. Small bold
  white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green
  button at bottom center. Deep dark purple background. Premium still
  life photography. Museum-quality composition.

## Variant 2
- layout: classic
- headline: 25% ACoS Hides *45% TACoS.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic split-screen advertisement showing illusion vs
  reality. Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says 25% ACoS
  Hides 45% TACoS. across the upper third. Below, a dramatic
  split-screen divided by a thin vertical line. The left half shows a
  clean, healthy-looking gauge or meter reading 25% with a calm green
  glow — everything looks fine. The right half shows the same gauge
  but now reading 45% with an alarming red-amber glow, the needle
  deep into the danger zone — the hidden truth. The left side has the
  word ACoS in small dim text, the right side has TACoS. A thin mint
  green dividing line between the halves. Small bold white text that
  says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint green button at bottom
  center. Deep dark purple background. Premium data visualization
  advertising. Ultra-detailed, razor-sharp.

## Variant 3
- layout: classic
- headline: ACoS: Rearview. *TACoS: Windshield.*
- cta: Book a Demo
- model: xai:grok-imagine-pro
- negative-prompt: watermarks, blurry, low quality, ugly, deformed
- prompt: Cinematic split-screen advertisement with driving metaphor.
  Large bold clean white sans-serif text that says ACoS Rearview.
  TACoS Windshield. across the upper third. Below, a dramatic
  first-person view from inside a luxury car at night. On the left
  half, the rearview mirror is prominently featured showing a small,
  limited view backward with dim amber lights fading — the past, what
  already happened. On the right half, the wide windshield shows a
  vast open highway ahead with bright mint green road markings and
  headlights illuminating the clear road forward — the future, what
  matters. The contrast between the tiny rearview and the expansive
  windshield is stark. Dark car interior lit only by dashboard glow.
  Small bold white text that says Book a Demo in a rounded bright mint
  green button at bottom center. Deep dark purple tones. Cinematic
  automotive photography. Pristine execution.
